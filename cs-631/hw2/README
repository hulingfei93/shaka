/********** tcp1.0 -- trivially copyafile ****************/

SYNOPSIS
    tcp source target

DESCRIPTION
    The tcp utility copies the contents of the source to target.
    If target is a directory, tcp will copy source into this directory.

EXAMPLES
    The following examples show common usage:
        tcp file1 file2
        tcp file1 dir
        tcp file1 dir/file2
        tcp file1 dir/subdir/subsubdir/file2

EXIT STATUS
    tcp exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurred




/************* tcpm1.0 -- trivially copyafile via mmap/memcpy *****************/

SYNOPSIS
    tcpm source target

DESCRIPTION
    The tcpm utility copies the contents of the source to target. That is, behaves entirely the same as tcp(1).
    Unlike tcp(1), tcpm uses mmap(2) and memcpy(2) instead of read(2) and write(2), which is why it can
be rewarded with up to 10 extra credit points.

EXAMPLES
    The following examples show common usage:
        tcpm file1 file2
        tcpm file1 dir
        tcpm file1 dir/file2
        tcpm file1 dir/subdir/subsubdir/file2

EXIT STATUS
    tcpm exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurred.
