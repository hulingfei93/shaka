    ./sish -c "ls -l|wc -l"
    ./sish -c "ls -l | &wc -l"
    ./sish -c "cat | wc -l"
    ./sish -c "cat | wc -l&"
    ./sish -c "cat & | wc -l"
    ./sish -c "cat & wc -l"
    ./sish -c "cat & wc -l |"
    ./sish -c "cat | cat | cat"
    ./sish -c "cat & cat & cat"
    ./sish -c "cat | cat | echo"
    ./sish -c "ls -l >out | wc -l"
    ./sish -c "ls -l >out | wc -l &"
    ./sish -c "ls -l >out & wc -l &"
    ./sish -c "ls -l >out | <in cat >out2" -x
