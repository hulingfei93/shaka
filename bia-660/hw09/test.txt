The mp3 player I purchased work perfect for three weeks, since then every time it is touched more moved it shuts itself off. When you turn it back on, it goes back to the song that was playing when you first turned it on. It was never dropped or mishandled, so this purchase was very dissapointing.
I purchased three of these this summer. I am now back to purchase something different. For the MP3 part :: One died quickly and quietly. The other two took awhile.   When you first get them they work great but after awhile they start to act up.  At first it is little glitches in the interface and then they just up and stop working.  You can replace the battery and do a reset but that only works temporarily.  It must be some tiny part or something that wears out. The voice recorder and as a Jump drive they are still working today. If you are buying as a JUMPDRIVE and VOICE RECORDER Go for it.  The MP3 part of the deal is not worth the time or money!
Anyone who says this is not a good mp3 player does not know what they are talking about. If you shop around, you can get one for under $100.00. The sound is terrific and the earbuds that it comes with have a great sound. It is not only expandable with cheap SD memory cards, it also has a FM transmitter and an FM radio with a good signal. Simply put, the best MP3 out there, with every feature in players twice as much. Why pay for an I-pod for twice the cost that has no FM radio, no FM transmitter, no expandable memory and is limited on the music files it can download. Lexar should pay me a marketing fee for this review.
I want to give this product a zero rating! Within one month of purchase, the battery lid got broken and I could not put it back. I made a phone call to creative and was told that the battery was NOT covered in warranty. The replacement would cost me $4.9 plus shipping and package with totals around 30. I argured with the CSR and they just rudely hang off the phone. I will never ever buy a creative product again. Guys, if you want to waste your money and be treated rudely, do not hesitate. Otherwise, choose a more honorabl brand!  	0
My product was recieved in a timely manner and was in GREAT condition.  It was everything it was described to be. Easy to use and quite compact.
Seems me that is an excellent product he which will be me of great utility.
Ok, I give it to Philips for the killer good design: this thing looks awesome; i.e. if you like looking at mp3 players, buy it.  However, if you actually like listening to music, go buy a 20$ CD player from Wal-Mart, it will do a better job.  First, the sound is horrible: I bet that the earbuds are to blame (yeah, they look really cool too, but sound like crap), but never got to really buying an upgrade.  Second, the installation software won't even run, unless you have your XP upgraded with every patch imaginable: annoying.  Third, during the very first load, after getting about 130 songs on it, the device froze. I restarted it, added about 40 more and left on a vacation the next day. Guess what? When I turned it on, I had only the last 40 songs on it...   Finally, the device crashed for no reason whatsoever after being turned on and off three times and it took me about 20 minutes to reboot it.  I returned it after 5 days and do not plan on buying another Philips mp3 player any time soon: it's a pitty, it is the best looking player I have seen. It also has three times the capacity of similarly priced players, stores pictures, and has an FM tuner... If the designers would stay and the programmers at Philips would be fired, I would wait in line to get their next product.
bought 3 years ago.  battery always sucked but entire thing died today (despite trying all the "trouble-shooting" tips  Apple offers on website).  very  disappointing considering i paid $300 bucks for 3 years ago.  AVOID simply for the miserably short battery life alone.  almost missing my old walkman.
"Absolutly dreadful", as Simon would say...my mp3 somehow managed to turn my computer upsidedown and nothing will work. Not only that but the player itself refuses to work while trying to download my first CD on the day I purchased it, it just froze and now all it wants is to be hooked to the computer and its been that way for hours. I am returning it back to Best Buy where I got it.  A complete waste of time and money. Not even a single day of it worth while.
I have to give this player 5 stars because I can no longer imagine life without it.  I watch movies on the bus to work, if I'm having lunch by myself in a cafe, sometimes walking to the car from the bus, when I'm waiting for an appointment ... It is totally amazing.  Arriving at the gym without it can be extremely traumatic.  Listening to my favourite songs while doing weights at the gym is magic.   I actually have a 2GB model, but rarely need more than one because everything compresses so much and its so easy to get things on and off it. Some tips that I would have found useful are:  1.  Converting videos.  You first need to get the video into a format that the Samsung software recognises (in order for the program to be able to compress and convert it into an svi file to go on the player).  I understand (of course not through personal experience) that if one were to download a movie that it would probably already be in a format suitable to convert directly by the Samsung software.  Anyway, there are a number of programs that no doubt do similar things but since it took me a number of hours to sort out, I'll let you know that the ones I use are:  DvdFab Express to "backup" a copy protected DVD. Then I get Imtoo DVD Ripper Platinum 4 to convert the backup DVD to an avi file (plays in a DivX player).   Then the Samsung Multimedia player converts the avi to svi. Sounds a little involved but very simple when you've sorted it all out (especially when you run a few of these processes at the same time)!  2. For converting my cds to files recognizable by the player I like WinAmp (which is a free program).  You need to set it up so that it will convert your cds to mp3 or wma format (the default wmp format is not recognisable by the Samsung software).  I found out the hard way that there are about 60 different quality settings for wma.  Converting songs to 1mb each (32kpbs 22kHz stereo cbr) I found gave sufficiently good quality (otherwise its tinny and slow).  Mp3 seems to convert to about 2.5mb per song.   Cons  One problem is that the navigation button (after five weeks of regular but still relatively gentle use) now jams in the up position instead of springing back (so I have to move it back to neutral).  My dilemma is mostly that I love the little thing so much that I can't imagine being without it for the period it would take to fix under warranty ...   The second con is rather minor and is directed at the Samsung software - when I transfer a playlist I have compiled over to the player it goes over in one click.  To remove the playlist however requires deleting every single song one at a time. ie press delete, click "OK" to the question "do you want to delete this file" move the mouse back over to the playlist to delete the next song.  But who knows - maybe there is a simpler way of doing this I'm too daft to it work out! (and in that case maybe someone will let me know ...)
