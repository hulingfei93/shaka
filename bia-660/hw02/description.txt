You are given a file called input.txt just like the one we saw in class.
The file contains 1 review per line.
You are also given the file positive-words.txt, which includes one positive word per line.
You are requested to write a python script that will find ALL positive tokens that appear in the LONGEST review, which (the review) does NOT contain 42 words or more.
The result must be written to a file called long_positive.txt
Each positive word that is part of the result must be in each own line (one word per line).

HINT: Your result should contain two words
