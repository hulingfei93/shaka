You need to write a Python script that reads an input file with the name input.txt
The input file contains the link to the profile page of a reviewer on Yelp ( www.yelp.com )
An example of the link contained in the file is shown below:

http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9I1w-E6w5c5FZhkXXLodZA


You Python script must go through ALL of the reviews of that reviewer and find the PRICE DISTRIBUTION of the places that this person has reviewed.
We also want to know the NUMBER of PAGES that these reviews span over.

The price distribution refers to the NUMBER OF TIMES that we encounter each price range.

Yelp uses 4 price ranges, denoted by the dollar sign: $, $$, $$$, $$$$
So, we want to know how many times that person has reviewed places with 1 dollar ($), 2 dollars ($$), etc.

In the end your script must write the number of pages and the price distribution to a file named yelp_counts.txt
More specifically, the first line must be the number of pages that the reviews span over.
Then, report the number of times the reviewer visited places with $. In the following line, report the number of times the reviewer visited places with $$, etc


Example: Consider a reviewer who has reviewed 5 places with $, 0 places with $$, 10 places with $$$ and 1 place with $$$$.
These reviews (along with some others that may be missing the dollar sign), are spread over 3 pages.
The file yelp_counts.txt for such a reviewer should contain the following:
3
5
0
10
1
