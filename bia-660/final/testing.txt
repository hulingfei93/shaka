Wexler's is boring and trying to be clever. They need to come up with a better menu and bigger portions to compete with Wayfare Tavern next door, which is always packed and need weeks in advance to get a Friday or Saturday night reservation. Was at Wexler's on Friday night and there was no wait with empty tables. If this doesn't tell Wexler's to spice things up a bit, they'll be cooked.	0
I love this place and the idea of it its shear contradiction (organic ingredients organic palm oil but still a sweet treat).	1
The service is terrible!!! The guy in charge skipped some people when they stand in the line waiting to be served. I think the staff there think they are the GOD. Customer has to worship them. <br><br>Soup is very very salty. <br><br>Bad bad experience. We will never come again.	0
The first two times I came here the fish tacos were out of this world. The last two times- not so great. But everything else has always been top notch. This little mom and pop shop is like a chipotle in that everything you order is made right in front of you. Love that we can get a real Mexican coke here too. The best part about this place? A family of 3 can get a good meal for under $20.	1
Kien's been craving it n I know Jon wouldn't say NO... plus it's on our way anyway soooo... got it! =DWe ordered to-go... they now serve alcohol... awesome! Perfect pairing for their burning hot wings!!!Valet parking... although, we normally just park on the side out of the way and let the valet guys know we're ordering to-go... no prob...Ordered on the counter... a bit expensive for about $1 ea wing. Half n half - garlic soy + hot wings = ohhhh sooo yummy goodness! We couldn't help ourselves, we ate a couple on our way home... haha our lips r burning hot n we don't have anything to drink...As soon as we got home, we devoured each n every wing... they didn't stand a chance... eventhough our lips r burning... this time we have iced cold beer handy to cool us up... LOLClean facility n we didn't really wait that long...	1
Westwood's Apple Pan serves up the best burger experience, West of Beverly Hills. The menu is incredibly simple - a couple of burgers, fries, pie, and drinks. If you're looking for a kick-ass meal on a Friday night, try the Hickory Burger with Fries, a creme soda, and a slice of their mind-altering Banana Creme Pie. Apple Pan's no-frills atmosphere will grab you as soon as you walk through the small wooden doors facing Pico (near Westwood Boulevard). There are no tables at Apple Pan -- just one long continuous bar that wraps around the master bedroom sized dining room. One of two bartenders will take your order and the team behind them goes to work building your burger as carefully and slow as construction on the 405. The fries and drinks will usually come right out so you'll have something to nosh on while your burger cooks on the open air griddle at the center of the room.Above all, the Banana Creme pie is my very favorite thing to get. It came on recommendation from one of the waiters and I've never looked back to the apple pie since. Layer upon layer of luscious fresh banana slices mixes perfectly with a mound of banana creme under a whipped topping. Mix all that with a to-die-for buttery crust...and...well...the only way to understand it is to go there and try it. Please, go there and try it.Some words of advice: The Hickory Burger is best eaten hot, so make sure you eat-in at Apple Pan (I took Apple Pan to the Pacific drive-in once, but this food is best fresh). What makes Apple Pan most special is the crowd of regular Angelenos that fill the bar stools everyday. They're what makes this place such a quintessential diner experience -- well them and the awesome red plaid wallpaper.	1
Extremely well priced-fantastic menu. We had a wonderful dinner meal,. Service was excellent!	1
Its popularity is exceptional, but not sure why. The food ranges from OK to bad, and don&#39;t expect any consistency. The service is FAR from good: the hostess is typically rude and the waiters are kind of weird. Their little shop with pre-made foods is not of very high quality and the items are overpriced. There are definitely places in LA with a similar vibe but far better quality (e.g., try Joan&#39;s on third for a cafe + food store combo).	0
This place was amazing. <br><br>It&#39;s located in the Pershing Square Building on the 15th and 16th floor. 15th is where the restaurant is located but the 16th, the lounge area, is where you&#39;d want to be. <br><br>Great 360 degree view of the city, decent specialty cocktails (I had the My Fair Lady) and overall pretty cool vibe.	1
We made last minute reservations and happy we did. The food &amp; service was excellent. The Owner Ron was very personable and showed us arond the Inn which is always a great feeling.	0
Authentic food from Spain. Great atmosphere and flavor!	1
If I could this restaurant a no stars I would. I have traveled the world &amp; eaten at some of the finest restaurants. Never have I seen such a rude staff. The view is not worth enduring the attitude we received when paying over $300 before a tip. Thanks but no thanks.	0
I found this place by chance while taking a stroll in the city. I was thinking an ice cold beer and a small sandwich would be a perfect afternoon snack. Much to my chagrin no beer or wine here so I settled for a pork sandwich and a glass of water. The pork was not as hot as it should have been and just lacked "something". Maybe it needed more aioli and a squirt of suracha. The staff was friendly and the vibe was good.	0
Lately the service and food has suffered tremendously. Most of their sausages are far too salty and their sides all need an overhaul as well. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless you are looking for a decent patio and a pint.	0
Tried each dish on the special Prix fixe menu- lovely.	1
I've been here a couple of times for lunch and for dinner. The food has always been good, the service has been really good. It is a bit spendy for what you get and the interior is a little over the top, but I've been there three times so far so that hasn't stopped me.	0
Came here based on reviews . The lady and I&#39;m guessing her daughter that was working there are VERY nice . Service was fast and attentive on whenever we asked for things . Let me start off with the broth of the pho. It felt very clean and non oily. The soup wasn&#39;t as flavorful as I expected it to be but in general it was still enjoyable. Came out nice and hot and the noodles cooked perfectly. Also gave us extra items on the house . Found my new pho fix in ktown . Also almost forgot the jangpong that they have there is delicious and also felt very clean. Portion is huge!	1
Food was bad. Poach eggs were cold. Slab bacon was misleading, they served thin cut bacon and called them slab bacon. Food was bland too. The hostess was not even friendly. Time for McD after brunch. <br><br>The waiter, Jonathan, was extremely friendly and attentive. The 2 stars were for Jonathan, food gets zero star.<br><br>My friend said Jonathan is &#34;comel&#34;.	0
We wanted a restaurant that was not a Pub or Asian, and had more than pub food and this Stephi's menu was great. We enjoyed the great selection of dinner salads and the clam chowder was thick and delicious. We did find the prices a little high but overall all the experience was good and exactly what we were looking for.	1
I went to this incredible restaurant with my friend Erik (who also wrote a review!) and the food was tasty and very good.	1
$11 for dinner. Cheap typical american buffet fare. Not much more to say.	0
This is the worse King of Thai Noodles that I've been to. I like lime, and the noodle I ordered comes with lime. Their lime had 1 drop of juice in it. I asked for another lime, another 1 drop. I asked for a lime that's more "juicy," they ended up giving me one small plate with limes. Each wedge this time had plentiful of juices and was enough to finally go around w/ all my friends. The bill comes, blam, $3 charge for a small plate of lime? Give me a &*$%ing break.	0
Great view!<br>Great seafood but the menu isn&#39;t very exciting...no bone marrow, no raw beef in any form, all the dishes are &#34;safe&#34;.<br>There were frog legs, but I didn&#39;t care for it much.<br><br>The Bouillabaisse and the Moules were delicious!<br>The escolar was a bit disappointing. It was a bit dry and the sauce it came with was too thick...it reminded me of gochu jang (korean red pepper paste).<br>Truffled fries...waste of belly space imo but my friends enjoyed them.<br><br>Whiskey on the rocks...is whiskey on the rocks. haha<br>The ice was melted alot the second time around. <br>Couldn&#39;t get sangria...I guess it&#39;s a brunch thing only.<br><br>We were there 7:30pm on a Friday night with a reso. Didn&#39;t have to wait a second. :)<br>Service was ok in the beginning but got really slow by the end of the night.<br>That&#39;s ok b/c my friend was feeling real good that night and started dancing the night away...oh pat~~<br><br>The best tip you will ever get:<br>The tables by the windows/doors inside between the patio and the inside of the resto is the most perfect spot.	1
Wonderful food and atmosphere! The grilled octopus appetizer is fabulous as is the skirt steak. Of course the frites with the garlic are a must. The house dressing for the beet salad used to be better but it&#39;s still fine.	1
This place is THE best hole in the wall cafe. <br>They have everything you ever dreamed of... for lunch. <br>Good meat, good cheese, good people, good ... you get the idea.<br>PLUS! They have a whole wall full of candies! CANDIES! SODA CANDIES to gummies to oddly small pieces of black balls that&#39;ll blow your mind because its so weird honestly... but its a trip trying out all the different kinds of candy they have there. <br>Occasionally they would have desserts too. &amp; what&#39;s good here? EVERYTHING. no joke. you have to try their dark chocolate bars too in the mini-mart section. OMMYGOODNESS it&#39;ll blow your mind out, so out of this world... not reallly but its SUPER delicious. <br><br>Candy: a biit pricey but I&#39;m always coming back for more.<br>Chocolate: depends what you get but the expensive stuff, the really good stuff, is worth every penny.<br>Deli: CHEAP! you can get a 1/4 lb of your choice of deli for about $2.50! and their meat is so good!<br>Sandwiches: again just choose anything or ask for reccomendations, you&#39;ll never be failed. <br>people: they are the sweetest people you&#39;ll ever meet, always delighted to meet to and hella bright and happy people. They at least brighten up my day for lunch <br><br>Check it out! NOW!	1
It's one of those places that makes you feel good about finding. Quaint neighborhood, cozy yet comfortable nicely done restaurant, unique/good food and drinks. They make a great tomato-olive oil spread served with the bread. Ordered a yummy martini... but seemed small for the $$. Variety of beers and wines... the red blend was great! We shared a couple of first courses to try their specialties. Shared a main course of Chicken under a brick with mushroom risotto that was wonderful.	1
Everything I&#39;ve had is excellent. My personal favorite is the ham and cheese croissant. Incredible! <br>I&#39;ve read the other reviews and yes, not everything can be the best, but my family has eaten at GC over 20 times and I can honestly say this place is worth 5 stars.<br>Yes lights are a bit bright for me and the place could use more warmth inside but I still come back for the friendly service, and delicious food.	1
My kind of place.	0
Had a great experience here.Nice modern space, but don't expect a small intimidate restaurant. This place is big.Favorite dishes: cauliflower nachos, ceviche negro and dorados tacos. I suggest you skip the mushroom taco. They only have one item on the dessert men, the flan, but it's definitely worthwhile. Wouldn't preferred it without the orange slices. Still, very good.Only negative comment: our service was slow the night we went.	1
Weary and I got off on the wrong foot when I tried to order an iced coffee at brunch and was told they had coffee, they had ice, I could make it myself. Woah, woah, woah... a simple we don't do espresso and we don't have a cold brew would have worked. But it's close, a slew of friends have urged me to get back there, and last month I did. And since then, I've been back about four times! Mostly for drinks at the bar, which in my opinion is the best place to sit there. But I've also had dinner and have to say I'm a pretty big fan! It's bananas from about 6:45-8:00, so if dinner is your idea, get their early. Otherwise if you just want to gab, go there a little later in the night. And if wine is your thing, they have some of the cheapest (and best) wines by the glass in Madison.	0
The menu is limited and the mac and cheese wasn&#39;t even that good. Disappointed I waited so long to try this place!	0
No surprise that the pizza was phenomenal...it&#39;s Michael! His food always amazes!<br>At Pier 6 there is fine food, a spectacular venue and a staff that could not be more accomodating! Denise-thank you for the perfect party; everyone was so impressed. I know you will be seeing them again and again.	1
Aida has a new chef, and I like the dishes I've tried that he's added to the menu. There's a small entree option, which I like. My husband's salmon and my scallops were perfectly cooked.	0
The drinks are great, especially the margaritas. The food is tasty and ideal if you like sharing. I would give 5 stars but the menu is a little limited in my opinion, good food, cool place and definitely worthy of a visit.	1
The Reuben and the salads were great, all the food has a farm to table feel, comfortable place to eat... Excellent service!	1
I had a really fantastic brunch experience here. I went a bit earlier on a Saturday morning (11AM) and the moment I walked in, I felt like I made the right choice. Unlike so many brunch spots in Williamsburg and Downtown Manhattan, anywhere you sit in this joint gives you tons of space to spread out and have private conversations with your group. My group chose to sit at the bar because the bartenders and owner (Adam) were all very charming and good looking. The menu was infused with Southern-style staples and the cocktails were no joke. We all ordered something different and the portions were huge so we shared. Everything was equally top notch. Definitely will make plenty of stops back here. The beer selection appeared to be great as well. Oh, and everything is far more reasonably priced than most joints in this neighborhood. Go there right away if you&#39;re even thinking about it.	1
THIS PLACE IS THE TRUTH. THANK YOU, BASED GOD. <br><br>Never again shall you be disappointed by Oaxaca, Villa Pancho, and all the other Mexican food pretenders.	1
Best falafel,<br>Best hummus,<br>Homemade focaccia,<br>+ I had some inventive soups that were A++.	1
I&#39;m here all the time for the egg sandwich. It&#39;s not so much an egg sandwich as a nice fluffy omelet, loaded with herbs and cheese, layered with tomato and arugula on rosemary foccacia. For $5. The coffee always tastes freshly made, and the servers are attentive and friendly. If they ever have a special of the day, order that, because it&#39;s always been great when I&#39;ve tried it.	1
WOW sooo overrated. The food here is not that good! The beef was dry. The rest of the dishes were pretty mediocre. The crab was decent but nothing to die for. And they only gave forks to the few Caucasians at the table? What the hell is that all about? I made reservations for a table of 12 and we were seated right away so that was easy. But I definitely would not come back here for Chinese food.	0
So there are like a ka jillion reviews of this place so Ill keep this short. I recently fell prey to my own weakness for sugar and went on a quest for the a good banana cream pie. Many places have too few bananas. I don't want monkey amounts but one slice of banana per 2 square inches is much too few.Some joints have too much whipped cream. While most nights I can be found on my couch suckin on a can of the stuff, I don't want it drowning my pie (that's not what she said =D)The Apple Pan had the holy grail of BCP! A generous amount of bananas and a happy balance between the cream and pie filling. I ordered to go because A) I didn't want people judging me for eating more than 3 slices and B) It's hard to find a seat straight away on a weekend night. C) The pie is not at all soggy so it can travel well.Yay for banana cream pie at the Apple Pan!	1
if youre feeling bougie and want some healthy looking food that tastes like money this is place to go. theyre generous on the portions at least.	0
flavorful spicy and not too heavy vegetarian curry	1
Ehh, I wanted to like this place more, but I just wasn&#39;t feeling it. They barely have a wine list to choose from, their menu is tiny, and the food was just meh. <br><br>I had the tilapia on top of a salad, but the &#34;salad&#34; was literally lettuce and 2 slices of tomato. NOTHING ELSE. What?! strange. <br><br>the house pickles we shared were gross--it was picked string beans, hot peppers, and carrots--not what i expected and not very good. <br><br>no desire to come back here really, unfortunately.	0
surprised i've never been here beforeduring the last three years living right across the streetdidn't get the sushi this time just one nikudon (beef bowl) and lunch combinationthe food was all pretty goodand surprisingly reasonably pricedthe place was also packed to the gillseven at 3pm on a sundaywill definitely be back to try the sushi	1
The Six Burger is the best burger in West LA. Coupled with handcut fries and mello decor, I&#39;ll be back for more.	1
I only got a coffee here (pretty good) but my buddy, who lives in the hood, swears by the place--especially the sandwiches (which have a Mediterranean bent). The setup is interesting-- a deli counter in the back, a long communal table in the center for the WiFiers (smart), and a few dine-in tables by the window.<br><br>One bit of decoration advice: Time to get rid of those cardboard boxes on the shelves against the wall. You guys moved in, so make yourselves at home!	1
I order from here all the time they deliver quick and the food is always yummy and consistent! FIVE STARS :)	1
Treated my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner since I had a few recommendations from friends to come. We valeted the car and took the elevator up. We had a 8:00 reservation but the host mentioned it may be closer to 8:30 if we wanted an outdoor patio seat. Went up to the rooftop, which was absolutely breathtaking and got two of their signature cocktails.At 8:20, we got a text saying that our table was ready and we got quickly sat outside with a view of downtown. We started off with a bottle of wine, octopus, and tuna tartare. I got the salmon entree and boyfriend got the lamb ravioli. Portions were smaller than may have been expected for that price point, but it was totally delicious and worth it. Upon hearing that we were celebrating a birthday, our waitress brought out a complimentary dessert.In short, Perch has absolutely beautiful views and the ambiance is amazing. The live band contributed to the evening. I would definitely love to return when I am not shouldering the entirety of the bill.	1
What a bummer! This place used to be great.Its clear that Suzu Noodle House has had some changes. I don't know if its a new owner, management or chef but what ever it is...it's NOT working. Suzu used to be my family's "go to" place for ramen when in Japantown. What we were served was mediocre at best. The bright fresh vibrant ingredients have been replaced with bland, boring, blah. Ever since I read David Cheng's inaugural issue of Lucky Peach magazine devoted entirely to the art of ramen I've been searching for the perfect bowl. Suzu was never the perfect bowl but a least it was tasty. So bummed! If anyone has a good recommendation for ramen in Japantown (or any where) please let me know.	0
i waited till i didn't have to wait in a line around the block. boy am i happy i wasn't one those fools. if you like this pizza you like Domino's, not that is the worse it just aint the best.4 or 5 pizzas of all the same ilk, they don't slice it and even though they warn you on the menu they give you a dull serrated butter knife so you can tear it to shreads. what the appeal of this place is i don't understand or maybe just maybe all the hype and the lines we a very very good PR ,move. either way the place is so overrated i cant believe it will last. i don't mean that in a mean way like i hope it fails. i don't want any small business to fail but i hope if they care enough to read yelps they will get off their high horse and simply serve some quality pizza at a decent price. for thin crust, Lu Lus for thick Little Star or lets face it a dozen other options in the city with out the overblown coolness.the space very cool looking and since i didnt wait in line the service although a bit confused was not horrible.	0
Service staff let us waiting for more than ten minutes to take our order, restaurant was 30% full, they were laughing and having fun among themselves. Burgers were super overcooked, and totally blend.<br>I used to come quite often but looks like this place is not the same.	0
The food was good and I would recommend the rolls	0
I went here for my birthday dinner while in Vegas . I made a reservation for 730 and was immediately seated next to a table of 4 older gentleman who were loud and abrasive. They were there eating because they won big on the football game which I could care less about. I tried to ignore them over the awesome Classic rock that was playing in the background but could not. They were so derogatory I just wanted them to leave. our server was prompt courteous and helpful . We ordered a field greens nothing special salad, split the pappardelle bolognese and I got the veal chop. My boyfriend got the sirloin steak. We also got a side of Brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes. Way too much food for us! Every thing was ok. Not mind blowing  but good.  200 dollar good?? I'm not so sure. I don't know maybe if I could focus on my date and not those old men it might have been better for me. I will give the B and B burger joint a try!	1
The best bar/restaurant in the neighborhood! The vibe is perfect on weeknights; weekends are bit busy. BUT the drinks are AMAZING and the food is, too! A new chef just took over, so I&#39;m hoping my favorite food, the market artichoke, isnt discontinued. But I will come several nights a week regardless! The servers, bartenders, bussers, etc are all really friendly and down to earth. Honestly this place is the perfect middle ground between scene-y and divey. If you hate both extremes, go to Churchill.	1
Three days before NYE and our friend's 30th birthday, Churchill changed their agreement with us and left our party of 30 people with no plans. Their management is unreliable, unprofessional, and this place doesn't deserve any business. It's too bad they didn't try to accommodate us.	0
I really like this place and my wife doesn't. Mediterranean Pizza. Good prices. Light on the toppings though. Which may be good for some. Fresh ingredients, lots of selection and brick oven baked.  They get a little lower mark from me because it is a bit small and atmosphere could be a lot nicer if they were larger. They are sort of part casual dining part fast food diner. 3 of 5 stars for a casual dining experience.	0
I have to give them the benefit of the doubt. With so many good reviews that rave about them.<br><br>Everybody can have a bad night right? Was that the case last night?<br><br>Whatever the case, they should be ashamed to serve such dishes and call themselves italian. I take exception. Have they had a nightmare in the kitchen? If so, why don&#39;t you just say so to your customers, and with a glass of wine on the house, problem solved. Being honest and straightforward should be the way, yet not a word.<br><br>So as we wait for an hour or so for our starter (salad), I look around and nobody is getting served, people looking around and towards the kitchen in the hope that food starts coming out.<br><br>We ordered fettucine ragu and gnocchi in tomato sauce. When they arrive they are both drowned in tomato sauce out of a can, both the same, tastless. What is that all about. I read the reviews and people rave about their gnocchi. <br><br>So I aks myself: <br>1) Has everyone gone mad?<br>2) Have I gone mad and can not recognize greatness?<br>3) This shite is not the ususal fare they serve.<br><br>So, with the benefit of the doubt, I&#39;d go back. But, hey I had to pay for last night and no words of apologies from anyone, so I probably won&#39;t<br><br>Yelp. power to the people.	0
Even though we made a reservation we still had to wait a while before we could get sat. It ok though because Ive heard alot of good things about this place so I couldnt wait to try it out finally. When we finally sat at our table the first thing I thought was that there is no privacy. We were a table for 2 and we were about a foot away from the table beside us and could even listen in to their whole conversation. Whatever, theyre a small restaurant and just trying to get as many people sat in the small space they have. The waiter good at making sure we were happy and even recommended some things to us such as the filet mignon (I was ordering the steak and fries when he brought this up) and was not disappointed with it. After the meal they brought over the platter of desserts and although I wanted to get them all, I settled with the pot de creme and the chocolate tart. Pot de creme was great but the tart tasted like I was eating straight ganache. I love sweets but couldnt even finish it since it was so rich. Not a typical cookie cutter restaurant which is what i love about this place.	1
This is truly an excellent local native restaurant. Food is really good. No better yuca anywhere. The sandwiches are loaded with meat. Portions are large and prices are what you want in a local restaurant. Don&#39;t expect a fancy restaurant. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s more like a local cafeteria. Bright, noisy and just plain comfortable and fun.<br><br>That being said, when you are finished with your meal, for dessert, go next store to the bakery. The desserts are yummy and the cafe con-leche is the best. Try the almond horns and the pastelitos. Great restaurant!	1
I wanted to like this place because it&#39;s in my neighborhood and I love tacos. I had the maple fried chicken and the pork al pastor tacos. Both tacos were filled with chunks of fat. Who puts a chunk of pork that is all fat into a taco for a customer and thinks that&#39;s acceptable? I had to spit it into my napkin. Even the chicken had chunks of fat. I get leaner meat at the local taco stand. Also, when our water was empty, the waiter kept taking our glasses away instead of asking if we wanted more water. I had to ask for a new glass twice. I was really disappointed in this place.	0
Great dive bar with really good food. Burger and fries are outstanding (some of the best in Madison). Beer selection is good.	0
I&#39;ll keep this short and sweet..<br><br>There is no such thing as good sushi at a japanese buffet. Some of the cooked items are decent, but the sushi is HORRIBLE.	0
This place was horrible!! 9$ bland burritos, no flavor at all. The salsa, its not that special either. Everything there tastes like it was out of a package, nothing seems fresh at all. Gaucamole & chips is 8$!! If you ever have the chance to go there, just take 20$ out of your pocket and burn it and that should be about the same experience I had.	0
I and the group of 6 who I was with ate at the Diamond Tavern due to our time constraints between conferences. The first night the food was good but the service was very poor. The second night, the service was very good, and food was average.	0
Tried this place for lunch because my friend wanted to be healthy...I'm not a fan of health food, but do like some vegetarian dishes... But No butter, No Milk, No Sugars, No Msg ?!?!?! I thought how good can this be?!?! Well I AM damn happy we tried this place!! This place is excellent!! Had the Chicken Veggie pizza = Amazing!!, and my friend loved the Chicken Risotto!! Definitely going back...probably until I've tried everything on the menu!! Oh and they have a Waffle and ice cream dessert..DEFINITELY on the menu next time!!	1
This place is over-rated. I came here at least four times to just make sure the high rave about this place stays true to their words, but I was disappointed all four times. <br><br>I came here around 11pm after work since I was hungry and it was conveniently close to work and the subway station. The buffet was closed so I opt for the warm premade packages that have been sitting in a plastic container for the whole day.<br><br>The tuna Kimbap and spicy kimbap both tasted awful<br>Bulgogi was really dry<br>Japchae was DRY TOO and had a weird taste. I had to throw it out.<br>Garlic Chicken tasted like chinese take out.<br><br>Overall cheap, but poor quality. I like their choice of drinks in the back, but other than that i&#39;m not going back. Not worth my $6	0
I hate to say, the food here is just really not that great - bordering on awful. I had the fried chicken, my friend the brisket sandwich. Neither has much flavor, and at $10+ each, with a 20+ minute wait each... Let&#39;s just say I won&#39;t be back. The chicken has no flavor. It didn&#39;t come out hot, the fry was not crispy at all, and the meat, even the dark meat, was more dry than overdone breast meat, so much so that my jaw started to hurt. It had no flavor. Truly an accomplishment if I think about it. The slaw needed salt and had over powering dill. And pickles? I was expecting your standard crisp pickle. It was okra. Gross. Not a fan of the slimy texture. The brisket, also tasteless. I imagine the positive reviewers are just taken by the decor, but really don&#39;t know good food.	0
I&#39;m upping my report to a 5 star. Everytime I come here people are the best! Customers chat with you, help you find stuff. The owners chat and help you out. I never leave without free stuff extra. <br><br>Get this, they have fresh almonds in their pods straight off the tree. It was the best almond I&#39;ve ever had, like a science lesson too. They have a new pictorial menu with more options. Their hummus is perfect, spinach pies are the best in town and veggie friendly, their grape leaves are moist and fresh. Y&#39;all need to check it out and start patronizing pronto!!!	1
Very pricy, very small dish, food does not taste anything special. Do not worth the money at all.	0
great food but if you are going to order to go i suggest you call ahead. the wait here can get long	1
Oh my yes. My bestie has been going here since they opened, she&#39;s friendly with the owner. She&#39;s been trying to get me to come to the mainland to check it out, and I&#39;m SO glad I finally did.<br><br>First of all, the decor. So cute, it&#39;s beyond words. Like walking into someone&#39;s really adorable home. I love their creativity with the wallpaper, I love the mismatched chairs, I love the bathroom. Everything sweet &amp; clean.<br><br>Now the food. Local. Organic. Vegan friendly. DELICIOUS. I started with the yuca fries. Granted, I&#39;m obsessed with yuca fries. But these were the best yuca fries I&#39;ve ever had. The miso soup was phenomenal: heartiest, most substantial, most flavorful miso soup I&#39;ve ever had (bestie&#39;s 2-year-old had a cream of yuca soup (vegan broth based! yes!) that I was happy to help her eat, also amazing). The macrobiotic platter was delicious, and the guava sorbet, WOW.<br><br>Super vegan friendly &amp; super tasty, I will definitely be hitting this place again. YUM.<br><br>P.S. For those of you who are not vegan, my bestie says to try the flan.	1
This place is ridiculous! First, let me explain that the food is no big deal at all. Know you are paying for the view. If you want to just go outside and have a drink, and someone orders an appetizer, they charge you a 10 dollar sharing fee (even if and when you order a drink). I will never come back here again! <br>When the server or the greeter finds out you are not interested in ordering anything to eat, they come by and take your utensils (so there is no way of attempting to share a dish no one can finish alone anyway).	0
I swear I eat from this place once a week. Always extremely quick delivery and easy pick up for when I&#39;m walking my dog. They also pack their to go boxes very thoughtfully.<br>My classic order is the spring rolls (off the Vietnamese menu) and the pho with beef eye round. Everything tastes very authentic and fresh. Also great for their Chinese lunch specials! Bubble tea&#39;s not bad either. <br>I really don&#39;t have one negative thing to say about this place. They&#39;ve been a great addition to my side of Brickell, and have managed to save me from many a hangover. I love 3 chefs!	1
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. Yesterday I returned for my 3rd visit. The food is amazing! The quantity is fantastic! Prices are cheap! When I go, I order the Chicken Katsu and a side order of Vegetable Egg Roles. This totals about $12.00. The Chicken Katsu comes with rice, macaroni salad, miso soup and salad (which is to die for!). <br><br>They offer your typical restaurant drinks: Coke, etc. along with Hawaiian Sun drinks. BIG plus!	1
I was really impressed by this place. <br>The food had very good presentation and it tasted very delicious. <br>This will definitely be my new hang out spot.<br>The owner and chef were.very nice and attentive. <br>This is the kind of place you really want to support.	1
Gross!!!! This is some of the worst pizza I&#39;ve ever had. There is no flavor. It feels like rubber. And I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not even real cheese.	0
We booked Blossom based upon the Open Table rating.  We like Asian Food, but don't generally book Asian restaurants on vacation.  Blossom changed our minds.We enjoyed a couple cocktails at the bar before dinner, they were excellent.  The bartender was fun and attentive.The meal was an experience.  The appetizers were great (get the green beans) and the main courses were unique and delivious.	1
Came by this place because my brother recommended.<br>Small space and about 12~18 people can fit in here. Not a lot of wait because it was late at night.<br>First of all, the foods are over priced. If i have to pay almost 40 dollars including tip for a small portion of fish and a small pot of dwen-jang pot and a meat combo, I&#39;m not gonna be happy and probably go somewhere else. The meat quality wasn&#39;t really fresh too. Most of the meat were tendons and little pieces that&#39;s about to turn into powder.. <br>Below average service even when it wasn&#39;t that busy.<br>I wouldn&#39;t go back unless my brother force me to. There are lot of other good Korean restaurants in/out of LA.	0
Great sushi, great wait staff, but the way they take/don't take reservation is a big issue. 45 minutes wait on busy nights so the need is there but they don't call back, or accept reservations for less than 6 people. And then they only take 2 reservations per night for the entire restaurant. Curious to say the least.	0
Best dining experience in LA. Period.<br><br>Somehow snagged seats on my first attempt... now currently salivating at the thought of going back, whenever that may be :)	1

It's a cute place. I wouldn't mind going there for drinks but I don't think I'd eat there again. There was a pretty long wait. The service was bad (in terms of time and courtesy). The food was just OK (but pretty bad value considering the really small portions and high prices).Wouldn't recommend it to be honest.	0
Surprisingly not many reviews for this great little BBQ joint. I stopped in for lunch, but my thought was that the TVs and blues music would make for an ideal spot to watch a game with friends. Great BBQ. 2 sauce types, regular and spicy, both good, both on the sweeter side of the taste spectrum. Considering the lack of many BBQ joints in Madison, this should be on the radar for BBQ fans.	0
Baristas are always nice and I really appreciate them. Coffee's just fine. But y'all need to get a handle on your baked goods! Well, maybe just the bagels ... if you don't use them all up in a day, DON'T keep them! Give a charitable donation (all baked goods in fact!), send them home with employees, sell them for super cheap at night, anything but sell them to us the next day. I could literally hear my jaw crack/pop when I was trying to eat one. Ughhhhhhhhhhhh I spent money on that? Come on.	0
I was contacted by someone from Perch assuring me that my charge will be refunded. Great. Justice. I can move on with my life, right? WRONG. <br><br>Just got another call tonight from a manager at Perch about this mistake. I checked my credit card statement and saw that I still haven&#39;t received a refund!! How many people does it take to fix a mistake that THEY made in the first place?	0
my roommate &amp; i came here today for lunch. she told me they were known for their thai barbecue but i really like duck so i decided to give that a go. i ordered the S-10, which is the crispy duck dinner with shrimp fried rice &amp; steamed broccoli. <br><br>the duck wasn&#39;t really that great. parts of it were really good, but other parts were dry and difficult to chew. it also seemed like they gave me the back, so there were lots of bones &amp; extra crispy parts. <br><br>HOWEVER, their shrimp fried rice is amazing &amp; the portion is fair. admittedly there aren&#39;t many shrimp in it (i think i had 2), but it tastes so good i didn&#39;t really mind. i also really liked the broccoli (and i&#39;m not a big vegetable fan). <br><br>all in all, i&#39;ll probably come back again &amp; try the bbq chicken.	1
This is a great option on the Las Vegas Strip.  The entrance (on Harmon below the pedestrian overpass between Planet Hollywood and the Harley Davidson Cafe) is a bit hard to find, but worth the search.  Nothing fancy, just a great place to take the family for a casual meal.	1
Essential points: great draft beer list, great beer events, great food, good atmosphere (maps!), and good service. I've never had wine or cocktails here but I've heard the servers give good recommendations. This place is a must-go.	0
Service was outstanding as usual - the meat carvers came to our table frequently even when we all of us had the red side up and we did have multiple wait staff working with us to make sure we had what we needed.  Always a fantastic time when we do go here.	0
With meats cooked in-house and incredibly fresh ingredients, Chopping Block has the makings of a majorly successful sandwich shoppe. I&#39;m so excited that this place is becoming a part of the restaurant boom happening in the Financial District.<br><br>I came here on a weekday afternoon with my co-workers and although the wait for our food was long, it was way worth it. I had the grilled chicken, feta, fry sandwich and it was on point! Granted &#39;health&#39; went out the window when the fries were added to the bread, this sandwich was unique and delicious. Meals come with popcorn and a nut brownie. Popcorn leaves a lot to be desired, I think they&#39;d be better with fries...or even chips. Brownie was a tasty surprise! Everyone else I ordered with was satisfied with their meal and found it to be one of the better sandwiches they&#39;ve eaten in the Financial District. <br><br>Overall, I&#39;ll return--but cons include high price tag and slow turn-out. I hope they can work out their kinks and shave the prices by a small margin while keeping the same fantastic quality of their foods.	1
Best view of DTLA ! I loved the drinks and appetizers on their happy hour menu. The staff was nice and friendly. I will definitely coming back for dinner.	1
Achtung! Achtung!<br>There&#39;s a new German deli in town.<br>The place is clean, small and simple in a small strip mall. We met some friends there on Monday at 6:30, we had some other friends that couldn&#39;t make it til 7. Little did we know, they close at 7, the staff was so nice, they never said anything, kept a smile on their face and kept serving us. I felt so bad after I had found out we kept them there late.<br>I had the Rahm Shnitzel, the portion was huge. It was cooked perfectly, not greasy. The gravy was yummy. The spaetzle was a bit crispy which I&#39;m not use to but it was good. Doug go the West German burger with fries, he was happy with his meal. We saved room for some Apple Strudel, it was really good, the vanilla sauce on the side was killer, I could&#39;ve eaten it like soup.<br>I&#39;d be interested in trying their breakfasts or some of their fresh deli meat selections. They need to get a liquor license, a good German beer with some Brats would be great.<br>Donka Shane and Good luck Cafe Berlin.	1
I used to frequent Toast a few years ago and most always left happy. I hadn&#39;t been there for a year but recently went for brunch with some friends. They made some changes to the food and presentation, and the quality of the food has significantly gone downhill. The omelette came out not very warm, the Oscar was bland, and everything that we ordered was just not as good as I remembered. Very disappointing.	0
Nice decorations and a all around nice restaurant. Other then that the service is lousy, the food is mediocre. Your 16 year old son can make a better meal at home. Very few of the staff members speak english and the bartenders have a limited knowledge of their own profession. Good looking staff and restaurant. That is all you are paying for here. I was outraged on the lack of service.	0
Food is good, service is OK, but the kitchen is slow. It&#39;s a good lunch option but expect at least 1.5 hours.	1
Best food, best menu, wonderful management. Great to people<br>With kids, shaded indoor and outdoor options. They really care about each customer. My kids say this is their favorite lunch spot!	1
Theyre always good for a late night breakfat sandwhich. PLUS 24 Hr delivery!... love it.	1
Best late night spot<br><br>No thrills, just good ol&#39; American diner with huge portions you can share. <br><br>The French Toast is amazing, one of the best. Its good old fashion french toast get a side of bacon and eggs and your good to go.<br><br>CASH ONLY, you can usually find this place with the huge line of people outside of the building	1
So cute! I really really like how open and bright this place is. When you walk in, there is a take-out type counter with communal tables. You can get coffee and also order food there if you plan to eat at the communal table. The restaurant and outdoor patio portion is separate and will require a reservation if you come during prime time. The menu is cute. Limited, but everything sounds pretty good. I really wanted to try the french toast, but since I just went to the gym and needed protein, I got the baked egg skillet instead. It's pretty small, but I loved how they mixed the vegetable with the eggs. Obviously very fresh produce used. There is a small mixed greens salad on top that is lightly salted. Delicious. It's not cheap for what you get, but you get good quality.I also forgot initially to mention the biscuit bites. Orgasmic. Don't miss out on this. It's heaven in your mouth. Dip it in the caramel sauce and butter they give you.	1
Loved this place!! The sushi was sooo good and the prices were great as well. The heat roll was amazing as was the cheesecake tempura. Will def. be back !	1
I had the most wonderful experience today in toast. The waiter was very nice and gave me his honest recommendation instead of acting like everything was equally great in the menu.<br><br>I got a mocha, and stuffed french toast. It was such a great meal. Very flavorful, and delicious. Served with fresh fruit and the coffee, that also came with two amazing mini cookies.<br><br>I left with a smile on my face an a happy full belly. Totally recommend going, specially after lunch hours when there was no waiting involved.	1
Our new favorite place.<br><br>Went in with my boyfriend last weekend. The two guys there were a)awesome and b)up-front about the wait we could expect (they bake the casseroles fresh, even if you want an individual size). The food? UNGH. So. Good.<br><br>We will be back. A lot. Sorry, waistline. You never stood a chance.	1
I&#39;ve been here a few times with some of my friends from school. The name SideDoor comes literally from how they built a sidedoor entrance to Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib to create a more casual restaurant.<br><br>As a Gastropub, the servers here really stress that it&#39;s a restaurant for mixing food and drink, and they don&#39;t hesitate to offer drink pairing with the dishes that you order. They are also a fan of sharing dishes family-style, but I find that some of the dishes - the sandwiches in particular - can&#39;t really be shared. I haven&#39;t yet tried the Meat Boards, which seem to be the main selling point of the restaurant; essentially, these are full meat cuts that come out in slices on a platter to share. I&#39;ll have to come back in the future to try these!<br><br>They also do brunch, but I haven&#39;t been able to try the brunch menu yet.<br><br>What I have tried:<br><br>1) Prime Rib Sandwich - My favorite dish so far<br>2) House Smoked Pastrami - I&#39;m not usually a fan of Pastrami, but wow, this sandwich was incredible!<br>3) Fish and Chips <br>4) Eggplant Panini<br>5) Rabbit Pasta<br>6) Mac and Cheese - my waiter told me that after I tried this mac and cheese, I would be dissatisfied with any other mac and cheese in the future. Unfortunately for me, he was correct. It was delicious!<br><br>They also have a giant list of beers on tap, and have a number of house - cocktails. I&#39;ve had a few of the beers that my waiters have recommended, and have been happily satisfied with what I&#39;ve tried.	1
Just came back from this place. Food was so so, drinks were not that special. Bar tender has some sort of preference as who he likes to serve first. I was standing around for over 10 minutes for a drink, comes over to ask and then leaves when someone (I guess he knows) raised their hand. What in the word?!?! Anyhow, that&#39;s my 2 cents. Go at your own risk and try if for yourself if you want but I would not recommend it.	0
Great sandwiches !<br>Only quibble, the menu barely ever changes. But it&#39;s good ! So keep up the good work !	1
Obsessed with this place! I was always a fan of Cobras and Matadors, but this place is just as amazing! The chips n Guac are to die for.. Along with the beef &amp; pickle, Chicken, and Shrimp Tacos! To Top off, I always get a fresh coconut. <br><br>The Price point is great for how tasty everything is and the ambiance is very welcoming! Definitely will be coming here every weekend!	1
Fun, fresh and fast! I good place for foodies on a budget.	1
OMG I got food poison, I went this last Thursday and order a salad, everything looks fine when I realized that the lettuce and other greens look saggy and old, I let the manager know I think his name is Ray or something like that, he took my plate and left without making any effort to help, he just make a stupid joke, I was in bed for 3 days and almost went to the hospital for the pain. Please check your food prior and be careful, you never know if this place can make you sick	0
I eat a plant based diet (vegan) and grabbed a "vegan" soyrizo burrito from here last night, as take-out. The burrito was so-so, and then I bit down on something chewy. There was a big hunk of red meat in the middle of it.Very frustrating and this shows that Papalote, at least this particular location, is not careful with keeping their grills clean and sanitized for those of us who avoid meat (albeit for allergies, or health, or moral, or environment, or other reasons).So yeah. If you are vegan or vegetarian: AVOID.	0
Soooooo glad I finally went! Had the steak burger w/ no sauce, fries &amp; apple pie. They were all fantastic! CASH ONLY but there is a Wells Fargo right next door. NO HIGHCHAIRS if you have a lil one. A little pricy but definitely worth every penny! A historical L A landmark that you must try!	1
SUAVE!ambiance: reminds me of the top floor in marquee, las vegas. hotel lobby-esque vibes meet creepy mansion living room fireplace? ...i dig it!eats:baked brie.. a little to pungent, needed more complimentary snacks to help ease the flavorduck confit.. amazing! a little overcooked and the portion was a bit dry.steak frites.. GOOD GOD! the steak was cooked to perfection, but the real star was the..little sticks of deep fried crack rocks with bits of cocaine sprinkled all over the top! the truffle oil? like the tears of an angel drizzled all over adding intense flavors making these fries INCREDIBLE.probably the b-e-s-t fries i've ever had in my e-n-t-i-r-e life!!oh yeah, ordered a cabernet which i don't remember because all i can think about.. is those FRIES!treat yourself, don't cheat yourself.FRIES FRIES FRIES	1
expensive, slow unappreciative service when empty (8AM on a saturday)...won't be back...food was mediocore.	0

I do not want to write a review.  I would like to write an optional note to the restaurant.	1
I love their honey chicken wings nom nom.... I honestly think it is a bit too overpriced but I go there quite often because I live one block away from it... not that much comolain about this place... good food but expensive...	1
Great brunch/breakfast. Good coffee, casual setting.	0
We went as a group in this new place, just to try. We didn&#39;t have a reservation but we were able to find a spot around 6pm. We were told we have to leave around 8pm.<br><br>Two hours after, after spending $800, we asked for a last bottle of wine. They answered that if it was only for a bottle of wine (and not eating - we already ate a lot to be honest) we have to go because they need the tables.<br><br>It might seems normal, but you have to know there were available seats for like 10 min before we were asked to leave.<br><br>We just expected them to be a little ore concerned about us, even more because it&#39;s a nice place - food is more than decent, the place is beautiful... And a glass of wine won&#39;t have make us stay longer than 15 min.<br><br>And just to clarify, I lost access to my yelp account and this is really not my first review.	0
Fainting Goat is really good. The owners are very very friendly and the serving size is a lot bigger than what I was used to in the East Coast. The prices are very reasonable. This is a good deal. The hazelnut is amazing	1
Disappointed! Pot roast dry, mac&amp;cheese is out of a Kraft box, clam chowder tasteless. Service awful, server not rude, she took our order, brought our food, gave us our chk, &amp; nothing more! &amp; even though we sat near a main aisle, where she passed ever few mins, she never asked how things were &amp; how we were doing, she didn&#39;t even refill our drinks. There&#39;s a flip menu on the table, saying u get a free dessert if a dessert tray isn&#39;t brought to u, I have never turned down a free offer, this time I did, I couldn&#39;t wait to leave. First &amp; last visit ever.	0
Comfortable, easy to have fun with a group, and delicious!	1
I&#39;m going to go against the near awesome reviews of this place and boldly ask, what&#39;s the big deal here? Came on a Monday with my fiance - I was in time for the brunch menu (I think $10.95 for an appetizer and entree), which he ordered, but I chose to order off the regular menu instead. He had the spinach salad with poached pears, walnuts &amp; gorgonzola cheese for his appetizer and the Grilled chicken, arugula, shaved parmesan cheese &amp; lemon aioli Panini for his entree. The salad was decent but the chicken was super dry and not enjoyable. I had an oversalted filet of grilled salmon with sauteed spinach.<br><br>I guess it&#39;s fine for the price but the way people talk about this place makes it seem like there&#39;s real magic that occurs in this joint and the truth is, you get what you pay for.	0
My first time today at stuff em! It was delicious. My two friends and I were in love with the salad bar, there are many choices! I got the mushy burger, it was perfect! Mike was very helpful. Ask for the green sauce on the side! Deff will be back to get stuffed again.	1
Every famous place can&#39;t keep their quality of food, I guess... I wish I can be here when they just grand opened..so I can taste how great they were, and give them a better rate...I&#39;m sorry I need to say their food made me very disappointed, their coffee r weak.. Nth to recommend.<br><br>Plus Not comfortable at all...rush rush and rush...I only stayed here for half hr because ppl here rush and gave us a bad attitude...	0
Drink the Cream Soda - don't eat the food. Seriously.	0
We had Pane Pane for lunch today. There was a selection of different sandwiches available and they were all substantial. The Artichoke and Hummus was wonderful a great balance of crunchy and creamy tangy and refreshing.	1
This is my second review and it comes 6 months after my last which the restaurant lobbied successfully to have removed. Rather than playing that out again I will stick precisely to what happened this time which was a deja vu experience. I was only willing to return after listening to a Edward Goldman review on KCRW.<br>Am seated and order drinks - 25 mins go by and the same manager as from the last visit is summoned to produce a $25 scotch. These guys are total jokers. Servers are like meteorites - they flash by you try and grab them and maybe if you are lucky you can order a hamburger as how long and how badly can this be messed up. Here&#39;s the answer 52 minutes and unbelievably undercooked and really dangerously pink.<br>Patina you may run this plave and it is certainly a gorgeous building but it is a joke how badly this stacks up to your other restaurant and how badly it compares to other restaurants like George in Paris or Sarabeth in New York at the Whitney.<br>No doubt Patina will use its muscle to eliminate this review but it is high time the blinders were removed and they proactively got involved in fixing what could and should be a destination restaurant	0
Not enough breathing space in this place	0
Didn&#39;t eat here, but had great drinks. Very fair prices. Genial staff. Convenient location near trains and bus.	1
Fantastic food! Definitely the tastiest we've had in the area. The atmosphere is a bit cavernous but the service was extremely helpful and I'm already craving the dosa and that ground chicken off skewers.	1
The one spot I got to go to for DineLA! <br><br>I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the service. The guys were great at giving us time to make our meal selections. They could have been better at refilling our glasses but it was nice not to get rushed to order, pay and leave. <br><br>Our order consisted of the Turkey Sliders and the Albacore Tuna Tartar to start off with. Then my friend got the Mushroom pizza and I got the seared Salmon with risoto. The Salmon was amazing! Perfectly grilled and paired with the risotto which was delicious as well. :) <br><br>For dessert we ended up with the S&#39;mores and the Banana Cream Pie. The Banana Cream Pie was phenomenal! We almost ignored the S&#39;mores cause of it. LOL! <br><br>There is street parking - however you need to read the signs and the street is pretty busy. I think the place is really nice, warm wood accents and paneling around the interior with the sunlight coming in through the windows. Great little casual date spot.	1
Friends of mine have been raving about this place for a long time and I finally got to try it. A group of us biked here from Union Station and I was starving.<br><br>Like everyone else has written there isn&#39;t much seating and it&#39;s all around the counter, but we got there right before the dinner rush so it wasn&#39;t too bad.<br><br>Everything is very old-fashioned; the decor, the service, and the food, everything is very simple and of good quality. They still use the same cash register they always had (that thing is an antique!), which means CASH ONLY.<br><br>I ordered the Hickoryburger and a side of fries. The burger was very simple; a burger patty, lettuce, pickles, sauce, and cheddar cheese. It was very good and I especially liked the smoky flavor of the patty. The fries were fresh out of the fryer, still glistening with oil, and were extra crispy.<br><br>A cute little old lady I was sitting next to was telling me that she had grown up in the area and had celebrated her 6th grade graduation at The Apple Pan the year it had first opened. Apparently the food is still just as good and still the same (although they have added a few items to the menu) and so is the old-fashioned decor.<br><br>My friends and I had all gotten our burgers at the same time as the lady next to me and I was shocked to watch this 70 year old lady devour it before any of us had finished ours.<br><br>I could have been satisfied with one burger and fries, but also got a Steakburger. It was good but not as good as the Hickoryburger. It tasted like a pretty standard burger without the smokiness of the Hickoryburger, and the sauce they used had some relish in it which was kind of weird.<br><br>The lady next to me was raving about how great the apple pie was, and when she ordered it she was talking to the server and they gave her the pie for free. She then turned to me with a giddy look of a child and exclaimed, &#34;The apple pie is FREE today! You should get one!&#34; I was skeptical of the pie being free to everyone but shared one with a friend, and it really was free that day! Awesome!<br><br>Since the apple pie was free we decided to try the banana cream pie as well and it was AMAZING! Everything tasted hand-made, from the whipped cream to the crust.<br><br>Needless to say the ride back to Union Station was a miserable one and my stomach hated me, but it was SO worth it!	1
Cool place but CROWDED and we spent the first hour and a half of our night waiting in lines. First to get in and then to get to the roof. Yeah, no pull at this place. That said, I was with a group of TWELVE and we had a fun night once we got upstairs.<br><br>One of the best things about Perch is the staff. No Dbags, everyone was nice from the door guy to the bartenders. That was unusual and made waiting in lines much more tolerable.	1
Really cool place. They recently renovated the space, so it is a lot more organized and clean. The food is really good, a little pricey. They have a great bar and serve a large variety of drinks. Great place for friends and large groups. <br><br>Good choice of Japanese food. Not the greatest quality of authentic Japanese food, but it taste good. <br><br>Great crab cake sliders and they are big. Sushi here is good not great. Nothing here really stands out but every things is good. <br><br>Overall a cool place to have big parties, and for those who want to drink. And since its in the heart of little tokyo, their is so many other options of places to check out.	1
5 Stars because this place makes the best dang red velvet EVER! The first time my friend and I tried it (sitting in the windowsill seat) we went bazzzzurck. Deep, rich color together with a dense moist bundt cake and thick not to sweet cream cheese frosting piped on top and inside the middle of the bundt. I asked the wait what wondrous planet these things came from and he said one of the chefs makes them using his own recipe. I would come to Fred's just for this magical, orgasmic experience and don't forget the decaf coffee to go with it. Boom!	1
Beautiful decor!! But worst customer service!!! Went last night the waitress sit us down, we wait like 10 minutes abd then another waitress ask us who gave you the menu??? We are close you dont see the open sign is off?? I think that was very rude basically she kick us out ... So dissapointed!!! The food looks yummi but i think latin burger needs to hire more respectful staff :(	0
Went to check out Gastropod after reading the write up in Seattle Magazine and though I enjoyed the food, probably won't be heading back. I think my experience would have been different had we been able to eat at the bar, but with the small space and open seating - good luck if you have any more than two people in your party. The food was delicious, but be prepared to share, as the plates come out individually. Also, unless you order a couple of the more substantial options, you may be left hungry. Lastly, they ran out of the most tasty menu items, so at least one party seated after us left because of the limited menu. The beer was great and it was nice that there were some microbrew options other than the Epic Ales. The service, unfortunately, was terrible. Took forever to order drinks after seated and then even longer to order food. We also kept having to order multiple drinks at one time so that we wouldn't be left empty handed.	1
I personally LOVE this place. I wanted to buy one of the waiters' tees (they say things like "emotionally unavailable" and "rehab is for quitters"... totally my type of humor). BOSSA NOVA WAFFLE SUNDAE. This is no joke. The thing is COVERED in ice cream and hot fudge. It's not like the waffle sundaes that you get elsewhere that have like one mini scoop of ice cream on the side. This thing is for real. Also recommend the fried mac and cheese balls. Great place to go at 4 am after a night out.	1
SOOOOO fresh. <br>I got two rolls. A spicy salmon and spicy scallop. The scallop was eh. The salmon was awesome. My brother got the bento box which had so much more food and variety for just two dollars more.. I shoulda ordered the same. The sashimi is SO fresh and tasty. There wasn&#39;t a wait when I went for lunch and the service isn&#39;t bad. I sat by the bar and it was actually pretty comfortable.<br><br>Overall: Average service, average prices, GREAT food.	1
Los Magueyes inspired me to write my first review! My boyfriend and I always use Yelp to find some good authentic food, something different from the every day chillis and cheesecake factory. We came across Los Magueyes and can honestly say it has become a usual for us. Everything we&#39;ve tried has been hands down, awesome! The guacamole is nice and chunky with tons of flavor and the margaritas are not weak!! I honestly haven&#39;t had one complaint. I&#39;m not sure why, but it never seems to be too busy. We even made a promise last time we went to try something new on every visit! Trust, you won&#39;t be disappointed.	1
"Dahling! How wonderful it is to see you! Please have a seat. Let's order some cocktails. Look how they bring us potato chips that are freshly fried in their kitchen. There's just so many beautiful people here. I just adore beautiful people..."And we're off to take in the latest shows at LACMA. Talk about an afternoon well spent. This bar is loaded with tons of specialty cocktails and a pretty extensive dining menu. Sitting here makes you proud to be an Angeleno. Yes, we have fine art, a great place to sit and be seen and we have such wonderful weather. Take that, New Yorkers! Don't ever give me shit about LA being totally devoid of anything interesting or culturally worthy.	1
The fried chicken is overrated. I can do better in my kitchen. It&#39;s also overpriced. The cheese grits were disgusting. There was some Cheez Wiz-like stuff involved. How do you f*** up grits? They&#39;re trying to do too much. The trick to soul food is to keep it simple.	0
Have been here twice now, both times it has taken 15 minutes and focused determination to attract any waiters&#39; attention. After being served the cycle repeats itself all the way to asking for the check so you can find any other place to go for drinks. It&#39;s a shame because the spot is really great, wish management could find good servers.	0
A great spot for a bite and a beer.In a town with many restaurants boasting gourmet or designer burgers, the Black Cats is actually good and not just for show. I'm sure the rest of the menu is great but the cheeseburger was suburb with a cold draft brew to top it off. Atmosphere is cool with friendly service a little slow at times though. And hard to beat the location right at Sunset Junction.	1
We enjoyed a terrific dining experience - the food options and prix fixe/tasting menu options were excellent.  Interesting choices, blending great ingredients and quality mains, without a lot of fluff so it was pretty perfect.  Slightly tight quarters but truly enjoyable.	1
Good food for reasonable price. Will definitely recommend.	1
recommended by my sister, this was the latest stop on my quest to find the best ramen in brooklyn, and it&#39;s definitely up there. i had the aori miso ramen while my hubby had the chang pong ramen. we both really enjoyed our selections, though i would&#39;ve liked to have had a tonkotsu option -- partly because it&#39;s my favorite, and partly because it would give a more accurate comparison to other ramen spots i&#39;ve tried -- it&#39;s hard to say how Samurai Papa ranks against Chuko when i&#39;m having totally different broths. SP&#39;s miso ramen was certainly flavorful, and while the pieces of sliced pork were definitely small as other reviewers have commented, i have to say, the soy sauce egg might just be the best ramen-egg i&#39;ve ever had, that thing was delicious. that being said, the standout of our meal was the pork gyoza, which were light, not too greasy or overly fried, and really yummy -- they might have even been better than the gyoza i had in Japan.<br><br>in the end, i&#39;m a little torn... on the one hand, this is less convenient for me to get to than Chuko. on the other hand, it&#39;s nice to be able to be seated immediately at 8pm on a Saturday and not have to wait an hour for a table. and ultimately, neither Chuko nor Samurai Papa are as good as my favorite ramen joint in Manhattan, which is really what i&#39;m trying to achieve here. so we&#39;ve got two places tied for second but the search for #1 still continues.	1
I tend to go on Sundays because the bar tender at night, David is really accommodating, nice and a lot of fun. The food is great and the atmosphere is cool and mellow. I've met the owners once and they were nice too. The Sunday brunch is awesome. They bring a little thing of lucky charms and fruit loops to your table to munch on as you make your meal choice which I love. Over all a little pricey on a budget but worth it a couple times a month.	1
Seeing all of the amazing reviews made me want to check the place out. Looking at the menu , it was hard to choose because the options are endless. I went with the Miami dolphin dog because i love the dolphins and i love the idea of sweet and salty on any food. I have had pineapple on hot dog before because it is like a Colombian hot dog so this was nothing new yet it was amazing. The prices are great and you will get stuffed for cheap, the only thing was the seasoned fries were under par compared to the hot dog. Will be back to try other dogs and maybe fit a shake in if it would fit.	1
I really can&#39;t seem to understand what the hype is about here. Maybe I got the wrong dish, but I can certainly say that I&#39;ve had MUCH better Thai food elsewhere. Yes, the ambiance is cozy (in a constraint way actually - the space is VERY small) and the place has some cute little quirks to it (a sliding bathroom door and these tiny little glasses that they give you for water) but that&#39;s about it. <br><br>I glanced around and noticed that the majority of people were having what looked like Pad Thai. I had the PAD WOON SEN WITH VEGETABLE which is a glass noodles veggie dish. It was OK. Not much flavor to it. I also tried my mother&#39;s WOK GINGER CURRY WITH CALAMARI and come to think of it, it didn&#39;t taste curry-like at all. It was very salty and the calamari were overcooked. They were too chewy. <br><br>I prefer Song over this place. So much cheaper and so much tastier. But it makes me wonder what all the hype is about when I saw a line of people waiting to be seated on my way out. I do believe in second chances so perhaps I&#39;ll come back and try the Pad Thai I noticed everyone eating.	0
This place wasn&#39;t even really OK for me. I didn&#39;t think dinner here was good at all. The service here was good, the food was mediocre.<br><br>DRINKS:<br>Poolside in Vegas (3 stars): This was different, had lemon sorbet on top which was interesting, a very summer drink.<br><br>Ginger Fresh (4 stars): If you like gingerale, you&#39;ll like this, it was very fresh and tasty.<br><br>Spice it up (2 stars): This was way too spicy, not bad, but need to dial it down a notch.<br><br>The drinks were much better than the food.<br><br>FOOD:<br>Prosciutto &amp; Burrata (1 star): This was horrible, first of all it was the tiniest portion ever. Second, the prosciutto didn&#39;t taste fresh and wasn&#39;t sliced thin, like it was store bought. Same with the burrata cheese, very low quality and wasn&#39;t good at all. I had to force myself to finish it.<br><br>Warm goat cheese fondue (2 stars): Everyone is loving this, there is nothing special about it. It tasted like plain goat cheese, came with apples and bread.<br><br>Roasted Brussel Sprouts &amp; Butternut Squash (2 stars): Way too many and big chunks of butternut squash, the brussel sprouts were actually good and had a nice flavor, but too bad there weren&#39;t many with all the butternut squash which was huge and not cooked evenly.<br><br>Vegan Kale and roasted beet salad: I didn&#39;t try this but my parents shared it and enjoyed it.<br><br>Wild Mushroom Pizza with brie, truffled creme fraiche and arugula (3.5 stars): This was actually a decent pizza, not my favorite, but not a bad item on the menu, it was better than my dish.<br><br>Jerk Marinated Half Chicken (1 star): I did not like the marinade on this at all.<br><br>Red Wine Braised Boneless Short Ribs (3.5 stars): OK these were actually pretty good, wished I ordered it instead of my brother. Still something I wouldn&#39;t crave and come back for though.<br><br>Special Rib-Eye Steak (2 stars): I got the steak special by the Chef, overly marinated with black pepper, they needed to cut down on that. I got it medium and it was, but for some reason it was well done chewy. I&#39;ve def had better tasting and cheaper flat iron steaks even. <br><br>Overall the food here was not good, and I don&#39;t think I would come back. We didn&#39;t even bother with desserts, my mom liked this place, but I did not.	0
Went last weekend and found out it opens 24hrs now. Woohoo~!Cz other usual spot had closed down and I was bummed out.I noticed that their menu had expanded so I tried their new menu, intestine tang. It was spicy enough to enjoy with Kimchi and rice.I finished the whole bowl. I actually crave for one right now. I will definitely come back here again.They have a button to call waitress on every table so getting service ontime is no problem.	1
Hate it being back at this place. I used to love it. Love the soy sauce flavor chicken. They changed the menu. And when I was there, I was WTF and the service was whack. The girl was a b1!2ch. Bad service. Bad combo. Don't ever eat at the restaurant. Jus take it to go or delivery.	0
who knew? those who are iffy about clams can be converted here	1

We'd been very anxious to go back to Shanghai Dumpling King (I recall it used to be called Shanghai Dumpling House). During our last visit, we had some of the best Xiao Long Bao we'd ever had in the U.S....they were quite small, exquisitely thin-skinned, and filled with a copious amount of deliciously scalding broth. Alas, those dumplings are but a distant memory. The latest iteration consisted of much bigger dumplings with little to no broth. They remained thin-skinned, but there was little flavor. Very disappointing, even when compared to Joe's Shanghai in NYC (of which I am not a fan). The best I have had recently would be the ones at Grand Shanghai in Edison, NJ, and even Shanghai Park in Princeton. We also had the pan-fried pork buns which were greasy, bland, and just OK, and wonderful green-onion pancakes which were properly greasy and crispy. I think we will look for another XLB joint for our next visit.	0
Coming from the amazing minds of TDA I was expecting a masterpiece of Mohawk Bend. Unfortunately if was a masterpiece of disappointment. The vegan menu is very limited. My fiance and I ordered the grilled artichokes to start (They were hard and undercooked) and each got a soup. Our meals came out before everything else and then a few minutes later our soups and appetizers followed. Over all my fiance and I were very disappointed. The food lacks the proper seasoning and when we left we were both still very hungry. A $50 experience we will never repeat. Definitely do not recommend this place if you are gluten intolerant either. <br>OH!! And they don&#39;t have iced tea!! Who the eff doesn&#39;t have iced tea?!?!	0
1.50 for elote in a bowl!<br><br>Same guy for so many years. He is so nice and he is very generous with all the toppings. <br><br>He&#39;s here late at night around 8ish-9 and stays past 12 sometimes. <br><br>Lines get long, but worth it.	1
Down the road from my house and offered outdoor seating? I&#39;m in! Went for half off bottle of wine Tuesdays and enjoyed two bottles with some friends. Server was very nice but laid back and busy--didn&#39;t bother me, I was happy with my service. Got the Brussel sprouts and bruschetta for appetizers and the turkey chili and burger for mains....all of them were lick your plate good. We stayed several hours enjoying the fire and chatting comfortably. I will definitely go back. Yes, it&#39;s small and only has one bathroom but you go there because it has great food and a good chill outdoor vibe.	1
OK. Well, holy cow... there&#39;s already 280+ reviews for Canter&#39;s on here.<br><br>It was my first time ever. I ordered the mishmosh and it was brought to the table by a waiter with the awesomest beehive I&#39;ve ever seen. He kept my friends well-hydrated with several rounds of Diet Cokes.<br><br>So yeah, the mishmosh. I&#39;ve never had a matzo or a matzo ball soup or schmaltz. Who knew it wasn&#39;t a gigantic cracker swimming in soup?! The ball--about the size of a baby&#39;s head--was more satisfying that a regular meat ball. The fattiness of the chicken essence with the matzo was magical. Magical! I could have fallen asleep right in the booth after finishing off my soup.<br><br>Other things at the table I wish I could have tried (but couldn&#39;t because it was a Friday during Lent), were the thick ass sandwiches, knackwurst, and over sized salads. Considering how they never close and maintain a pretty friendly staff, the prices were right in line with what I imagined. It&#39;s a pretty good value, if you ask me. <br><br>Next time I come around (which will probably be soon because the Regency Fairfax around the corner has a great Midnight Movie schedule), I&#39;m planning to plant myself in front of the bakery section and try every single cookie and danish in stock! Fat-tastic!	1
Been here several times. This place is close to my sister&#39;s work and the Saban (was Wilshire) Theater.<br><br>FOOD:<br>Pretty good. The pizza was good. I love the cheese... It reminded me of Chicago (the NON Deep Dish). So Good.<br>The pasta was alright... I got the Ahi Tuna salad and the Tuna was good... Very healthy... but honestly... LOVED the pizza. <br><br>DRINKS:<br>Sangria in a Bowl? HECK YEAH! They even have cute mermaid place holders on your cups to distinguished which cup was yours! And yes I did take those home with me. <br>But drink the sangria fast because ice melts and it waters it A LOT.<br><br>SERVICE:<br>Standard. It wasn&#39;t a busy night when we went and so he was good. <br><br>AMBIANCE:<br>Low Key Hollywood feel. It was dark and very Hollywood. It wasn&#39;t the shady kind but yeah, not bad. It&#39;d be good for a date cuz it&#39;s dark and kinda has a laid back romantic feel to it.<br><br>Overall: Not bad. I&#39;ll go back.	1
Before I begin, let me preface by saying that the above rating is only in regard to the visual aesthetic of the room, as I have yet to do a full inventory of the menu. As a denizen of the former establishment at this address, I thought it only fair to walk in at the end of the first business day to check out the new digs. Clearly, a strong vision was employed in the construction of the kitchen area, as it is the star of the room. The bar itself is flanked by the wall which faces Webster St. The taps do not actually reveal what beers are being featured, you have to look at the menu for that. Speaking of which, please be prepared before you pick up the food menu as you will immediately realize that you are no longer in Kansas (as Dorothy would say). Owner Dan Fox is an oink-o-file in the extreme, and the variations on the theme of this menu lays it out in spades. My next installment will cover some of those entries, but for now, lets just say that the beer selection was a little like one of those young broadway starlets trying to draw attention to herself, only to realize that the real action was not on her block. I can also say with impunity that the Central Waters' Hop Rise tastes as close to rancid ursine semen as I would ever think to imagine. I hope to give more details on the food in the next review, which will hopefully yield better results.	1
Beignets that will bring you to tears. A French toast that left me painfully full but completely joyful for the rest of the day.	0
Fast and quick. The kale salad with chicken was very average and not very big. The boar&#39;s head turkey sandwich however was amazing and something I definitely recommend. Make sure you get it toasted!	1
We had a great time and the food was delicious. We had a great service thoughtout the whole night. Thank you for great time.	1
It seems like selecting a restaurant in Capitol Hill is always such a task. Although we are surrounded by a plethora of choices in this neighborhood at some point they all start to mesh together. We decided to go to Nue last night, well, mostly because our friend decided we should. There were four of us and when we got to the restaurant the seating arrangement was anxiety inducing for my boyfriend. Our choices were squeezing into one of the long communal tables (people he doesn't know) or sitting at the bar (difficulty conducting a four person conversation). We chose the latter and I'm happy to report he found the conversation a non-issue. Not knowing much about the place and having a quick glance at the menu, I asked my favorite question, what's the story behind this restaurant? The kind bartender explained, Chris, who is the owner of Nue has traveled around the globe and is super passionate about food. His vision was to specialize in small plates, sort of like the street food he experienced during his travels abroad. I was content with that explanation and on we went browsing the menu.	1
The food is mediocre everything was burnt and tasteless I tried everything the pork belly the ribs potatoes etc I came in excited waited in line for 1.5 hours what a huge disappointment my fellow yelpers let me down :( on the plus side their beer is good<br>P.s totally not worth the price either $80 for little bit of meat	0
I swear I&#39;ve been coming here since I was 5 years old !!!! Best corn in town !!!! This man is loyal to his business and keeps everyone coming back ! The only downfall is that he gets here really late sometimes ! But definitely a great night time snack !! There is always a long line but it&#39;s worth the wait ! Nothing fancy about his corn but it&#39;s always fresh and always ripe ! There&#39;s a reason why everyone in Lincoln heights always keeps coming back for more ! We love him !	1
I went with my roommate to a preview dinner at The District. Located in a chic part of town, The District offers a luxurious and delectable twist to their menu which has Vietnamese food and some of your usual go tos. <br><br>I started off with their version of a margarita which had all of your natural, organic ingredients along with a spice (which I can&#39;t remember) that gave it an oriental twist. Very delicious, and how I love my cocktails- authentic and the perfect mix of liquor, sweetness and acidity,<br><br>For the food- it&#39;s best to order several dishes for the table as the dishes aren&#39;t too big and it behooves you to try as much as you can anyway. THE NOODLES are a must. I eat noodles and pasta once in a blue moon, but this experience almost made me permanently change my diet. We tried the noodles that were a side dish- had some butter and fresh garlic- and it was delightful. It&#39;s a shame I didn&#39;t try the noodles that were an entree. When I go back I will be sure to do so.<br><br>Good luck to The District! I am sure you will be booming with customers in no time!	1
My favorite breakfast place ever! I loved when i lived a hop, skip and a jump away from this place. It has such a good and broad selection of food. Everything is so fresh and the staff is awesome!	1
I&#39;m starting to give up on finding an Indian restaurant in Miami FL that is any good.	0
great chef loved our food we had a memorable night thanks	1
Had the pastrami on rye &amp; pickles. Pastrami was tender but really fatty. Rye bread was good, but crust was as tough &amp; chewy as a shoe. For a leaner and more tender pastrami, go to Art&#39;s (Studio City) or Katella Deli (Los Alamitos).<br><br>Pickles were excellent. I had 5 of them.	0
This review is based solely on the fresh juice and friendly service I always get at the Honey Tree. I like to stop by after gym class &amp; get the carrot, celery, beet, and apple juice with extra ginger for a little spice... Mmmmm so good that I finish it before I leave, every single time. <br><br>Although I haven&#39;t purchased anything else besides the juice and raw cinnamon rolls (not what I expected, but good), the shop is filled with natural and organic food, supplements, and healthcare.	1
I live in the neighboring apartment complex and dropped by since this place opened a week or so ago. This space now occupies where Arunee Thai used to be and has been completely renovated from head to toe. The space, now, features an interesting full black and white, almost Alice in Wonderland theme complete with a rams head clock and b&amp;w tiled flooring, tables, and chairs.<br><br>Lunch specials are completely worth the price at $7.50 for chicken, pork, tofu or $8.50 for shrimp and beef. Specials come standard with a choice of appetizer and entree. The lunch portions are generous with many different options to choose from. <br><br>We had the Pad See Ew with Beef fried spring rolls. Pad See Ew was not overly oily and had a subtle bell-pepper flavor. I had the curry pineapple fried rice - very fragrant and well-seasoned fried rice. Can&#39;t really go wrong here. Curry puff appetizer was more or less a curry empanada served over a small salad. Thai Iced Tea was not cloying but served in a huge mug - delicious! <br><br>Service is very homey and nice; We were greeted, seated, and waited upon with such genuine care and compassion. They checked up on us without being overbearing and made sure our water was filled constantly.<br><br>Currently, closes at 11PM but they are waiting for their liquor license to arrive in a few weeks before pushing back the hours. I saw that they had 6 different types of beers on tap behind their bar so the alcoholic in me is excited! More to come as this place gets busier and busier - welcome to the neighborhood!	1
A hunt for a salad bar in the neighborhood led me to Local. They told us to have a seat, and someone would be with us. They brought us water, and we waited. And waited. And waited.<br><br>There was ONE other table in the place, and 15 minutes was all we were willing to wait for someone to come take our &#34;order&#34; so we could go serve ourselves.<br><br>We got the hell out of there, and made the long drive to Souplantation, like we should have done in the first damned place.	0
Great happy hour! Loved their pizza and the mojito were delicious. Great place to meet friends and enjoy a conversation.	1
Great view of the city (obviously). Filet Mignon was good but not Mastro calibre. Not even BOA come to think of it. More like Outback Steakhouse but with less people from Okhlahoma. Desert was good. Slow service made us miss tip-off vs Miami. She paid for it with mean thoughts (but we still tip because its not cool not to). Also every one of my reviews says its bad for kids because I like my food without kids.	1
Are you serious?!<br>This restaurant is so ugly. There is absolutely no ambiance.<br>The food is average. The prices are high. <br>I just don&#39;t get it....def a mistake was made coming here.	0
Came for happy hr place looks nice..good ambience for the time of day (5pm ish). The happy hour menu looked interesting if a little pricey and you have to order a drink which didn't look like happy hour prices. I ordered the beef bo la lot and shrimp fresh roll. The roll was ok. Didn't come with hoisin or sriracha which I'm kind of used to. And by the last couple of bites the veggies were getting a bit gross to chew. Other than that they did seem very fresh and carefully prepared. The Bo la lot beef was kind of like Mediterranean style grape leaf wraps with beef in them. They oozed some sort of greasy liquid so I couldn't really stand to eat more than one. I pushed the plate back mostly uneaten yet no one seemed to notice or ask how it was so I just paid and left. For the two cheapest (tiny) happy hour foods and one beer and tip my total came to $18 which I think is up there for happy hours. I'd give it one more try because some of the other menu items look like they'd be really interesting to try as maybe the non happy hour meals are different.	0
Went here for Sunday brunch. Great food, coffee and the service was top notch. Perfect little spot that I will definitely come back to.	1
Went to this fun place with friends.<br><br>A belly dancer shows up like every 15 minutes, it&#39;s... kinda distracting for guys... I must admit that I wan&#39;t able to focus on food. *ahem*<br><br>Well, items we had are...<br><br>- Calamari steak<br>- Braised Swiss chard<br>- Almond filo/dough sticks<br>- Mint tea almond panna cotta<br><br>The food was good, if I recall correctly. Now, question is where I should put my money on her...	1
I like this location the best b/c it's the closest to me. It's pretty spacious and the waits aren't too long.Been here a few times now and I'm addicted to the Hatch burger, medium.I had to race myself here last weekend after a bad burger at Eureka!Burger in Claremont...Yes I ask myself why the hell I drove all the way there for a mediocre burger. uh! My answer...for a friend...(If he sees this...muy meeyan...but dude, my tbuds were not liking it)So yea, this is the place that did a spiel thing- trying to make me feel bad for wanting to add freakin lettuce to my hatch burger. SOU!Guess what? It was amazing-er!Anyhoo...the food runners here are pretty dumb (which is usually the whole staff)They kept thinking my burger was a Socal Burger just b/c of the lettuce...Obviously no thinking job here....doi doiI get my hatch with a light beer (usually Pranqster).Which is a great compliment to my burger.BTW, I hate the fancy splash of sauce on my plate.It makes my buns wet and gets all over my hands.So unnecessary and annoying.I've been very annoyed these days.Good thing I'm just rating the food.	1
Not terribly welcoming for vegetarians (there&#39;s one eggplant and one grilled cheese?) but other than that, the fillings are fresh and yummy, the seasoning delicious. These sandwiches hit your like a sledgehammer. A sledgehammer of yumminess. Portions are reasonable and filling! And there&#39;s seating outside, which I&#39;m always a fan of.	1
Love the 24 hr store hour and the online order feature. Pretty convenient. My delivery came 20 mins before the "promised" time so when I was hungry that definitely made me a happy customer. I love fries and boy their seasoned fries are the best fries I've ever had...	1
Horrible food! <br>Super fake italian version, the Tuna carpaccio is that thin that is impossible to eat and the arugula is FULL of garlic! Really<br>The gondola truffle pasta is undercooked (cruda) which is disgusting for ravioli or any filler pasta. And all butter	0
I dine here annually with important clients.  Good escape from the traffic of other Mandalay dining options.  And normally excellent quality. This year,we had an overcooked filet and red wine served so cold that we had them bring out hot water to warm up each bottle to get the wine to a proper drinkable temp!  I'll treat this year's experience as an anomaly and will be back next year.  But for the cost, you ought not have to endure these fundamental restauranting flaws.	1
I got the Ooey Gooey fries and the Kung Pau noodle bowl and while the fries were pretty good, the noodle was just WAY TOO SALTY. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me but I just couldn&#39;t finish eating it... and the place is just way too expensive. Should have tried the pork belly bowl instead since that&#39;s what most reviewers like.	0
Have another croqueta....with style.<br><br>This location offers the small restaurant dining experience with the same croqueta action. Located in Stefano plaza on 137th Avenue near Bird Road, this location caters to the &#34;north of Coral Way&#34; crowd. <br><br>The atmosphere is a little more grill/bistro with a splash of cuban bakery thrown in. You have a well rounded menu of favorites and some ritzy items like risotto and lamb shank to bring you a bit of fancy into your dining. Dinner service is often subdued, but Breakfast is always a packed house.<br><br>If you plan on coming here for breakfast here are a few tips....<br><br>Desayuno Criollo... it has everything including croquetas and cafe con leche y tostadas. A favorite of mine for a long time. I find it will satisfy even the hungriest amongst us.<br><br>Come early.... On the weekends the place fills up fast. If you arrive and see a line out the door, you may want to let someone off to hold your place while you look for parking.<br><br>Croquetas to go..... just because.<br><br>....and as always, if paying with a card, please leave your gratuity in cash.	1
Went here 2 mornings in a row. King Beach is open early and the early morning cyclists seem to have found this place!<br><br>Playa is absolutely screaming for good food, and the community has welcomed Playa Provisions with open arms. Seems like they are still ironing out some service wrinkles. Coffee took a long time and arrived after my meal. The prepared salads were supposed to be ready at 11 but came out half an hour late.<br><br>As far as breakfast goes, I recommend the coffee and baked goods. The hot food and sandwiches - not so much. I got the lentils which were just stewed lentils with an egg and a slice of bread for $9. Meh. The next morning I got the breakfast sandwich - the bread was too big for the sandwich and it was greasy.<br><br>BUT the baked goods are phenomenal. The gougere is to die for. Cinnamon roll yes. Pretzel croissant yes. You gotta be ready for a carb breakfast and coffee - protein isn&#39;t really the theme here.<br><br>Parking costs money but if you beat the attendants to the lot at breakfastime you&#39;re in the clear.	1
am i the only hater for traif? i really like the setting with the little piglet logo but i was kind of astonished by their high requirements. Luckily we had a party of 7 or else it was mandatory for each of us to have the $40 per person chef special. A friend of mine brought a drink from starbucks and they told her that she was not allowed in with that drink. the waitress told her its because they didnt want to a large company like that to ruin their ambiance. i understand if they didnt want her to drink it while she was attending this great dining event but this was no outside beverage at all. she just bought it before she came so she didnt want to leave it outside and she had to gulp it all down before she sat. I had to tell a friend not to come eat because it was mandatory to have the $40 per person course if there were 8 people or more. we ordered chicken wings, hamburger sliders, spare ribs, tuna eggplant kecap, softshell crab, italian pasta, and fingerlings. spare ribs were a little too sugary and so was the chicken wings. the sliders were good but not for the price. the softshell crab was great too but not for the price. i loved their serving style, it was very family oriented because it came slowly. a small portion of everything but that was also the downfall, the portions were way too small for the price. i expected a lot more from a trendy up and coming area. i believe the bill was about 240. none of the 7 people that went that night went home full after the dining experience. the tip was a mandatory 19.5%, more than a lot of manhattan areas i have ate at.	0
Great food and prices! Just wish the portions were bigger or there was something more included like a side of bread and hummus... there was a nice variety though so we&#39;d like to come back and try other plates :)	1
I have never been a big fan of their food. It's just been blah. Any random Vietnamese place makes better bahn mi and noodles. Previously, I did say I enjoyed their customer service. Tonight was not the case. We ordered one sandwich and one bun bowl. It took 45 minutes, while three people who ordered behind us got their food before us. Customer service was crap. No apologies or explanations were offered. They just looked around nervously without even addressing the issue or offering an apology. It was appallingly bad customer service. Oh, and a line cook wearing nothing but a sports bra is pretty unappealing. Their sweat can easily fall into your food. To top it off,our food was cold, soggy, and pretty disappointing. Never coming back.	0
This restaurant is a solid bet. Good food, good service. Wine list a bit limited. This is our default restaurant in the area.	1
No. This is not a food truck. This is a restaurant and a great one at that. I keep seeing comparisons to taco trucks where you buy your taco, eat outside and hope you don't spill anything on your clothes. I was skeptical but I have to admit from the very friendly staff to the different selection of tacos this is definitely a place where I will be coming back. I hear the rumors about the micheladas. Looks like I'll have to go back for some more detailed "research."	1
The Moselle is incredible! i mean the best i ever ate wow!! truly amazing Moselle....<br>i just tried the Moselle and i guess that the other portions are also legendary....<br>but the reason i giving Beehive 4 star rating because they close in Monday!! why?!<br>I wanted so much after a hard day work to relax with a piece of Moselle but unfortunately they were closed! too bad i think they could gain more costumers and popularity also if they will open in Monday	1
So amazing! Awesome lunch special with free edemame appetizer and fruit dessert! It's my new fav spot!	1
Ambience is good. That's about it. Service is below average. Food is subpar. Very small portion. Salad looks so tired and tastes tired. Meat is too rough to be chewable. Even fried calamari is unchewable. Disappointing experience.	0
We had a big dinner planned for 7 guys to celebrate my friends bachelor. To start the evening our table wasn't ready for the 8:30 reservation we made. We were finally seated at 9:45. By that time the suckling pig (the specific entree I came to this restaurant for had run out), but I didn't learn this until after We had ordered it. Because of this one of us changed his order to lamb and then learned 40 mins later that that wasn't available either, so then ordered lobster. To make things worse, the lobster came out 20 mins before everyone's steaks so he had almost finished his meal by the time we were served. I feel this shouldn't happen at a restaurant of this caliber. While they were not bad tasting the size of the steaks was also barely enough to feed the group despite us being very clear about how hungry we were when we asked how much to order. We were comped a small dessert plate because of the wait. We were all unimpressed with this $1200 meal. It didn't live up to its price or 5 star standards by any means. It was not the start to the evening we hoped for for my buddy's bachelor.	0
Did I get a &#34;Bad Batch&#34; or what? Got the Tocino bowl w/Garlic Rice &amp; 2 Eggs. 3 Tacos; Bisteak, Sisig &amp; Adobo. Unfortunately, the &#34;Shredded&#34; Tocino, Bisteak &amp; Sisig were just way too salty! If these are &#34;Franchise&#34; recipes, then it&#39;s too bad. If not, please taste the food before sending it out &amp; balance the flavors. Especially if people are going to pay $17+ for 2 small dishes. Friend &amp; I couldn&#39;t even finish the food and the serving was not big. High sodium dishes... True Filipino Cuisine! Lol	0
I am not sure how authentic Colombia food can be but this is definitely NOT a good place to enjoy. Food was awful. I had Colombian Fritanga, o..my ...god, it was so hard to swallow them. They over fire them and very very dry. My friend&#39;s pork chops were way too hard and bland. I also ordered Virgin Frozen Coladas and it had too much whipped cream in it. Overall, i am not very happy about it. I don&#39;t think i will ever want to return.	0
I ordered a Canter's Reuben with corned beef. It was gigantic, delicious, and beefy. I spread thousand island dressing all over it, making it even more scrumptious. The potato salad was sweet and just right. I wanted to get something from the bakery but didn't get a chance to. I will next time, though. A little bit pricey, but you get what you paid for. I highly highly recommend this place for good eats :D	1
GREAT STEAKS!!! Excellent Seafood!!! Awesome service!!!	0
Bluephies had me at Vodkatorium. Seriously, I was visiting from Dallas and happened to pick up one of those tourist mags in the hotel lobby to combat boredom. When I saw the ad I couldn't help channel Liz Lemon and exclaim  I want to go to there!. I Yelped it first, however, and was a little concerned over the wide array of ratings, but figured I would take my chances. I'm glad I did.	1
I loved it. Good pizza whose name I couldn't pronounce. N something. Hmm. Great coffee too (I was a grad student).	1
Okay. So I really wanted to love the food from this place because<br>of all of the wonderful, raving reviews, but just didn&#39;t. Waited in line <br>for approximately an hour before being seated at the bar, but really<br>wasn&#39;t bothered by the wait because the majority of reviews said that the<br>food was worth it. Ordered a half dozen of oysters on the half shell,<br>and thought they were just mediocre- yes, they were very meaty, but I missed<br>the saltiness/brine of traditional east coast oysters. Ordered the combo pan<br>roast with shrimp, crab, and lobster, and it was just mediocre too. <br>While I found the food to be just, meh, the staff was lovely and<br>worked very hard to please their customers. Would I come back<br>to this oyster bar again on a return visit to vegas, no,<br>but I&#39;m glad I tried it because I would have always wondered if I<br>was missing out otherwise. Now I know that I will not be missing out.<br>Save your time and money for something else.	0
We&#39;ve been quite a few times on weekends for breakfast and have been happy with the food, service and price. Recently, however, we visited and I noticed that the tables were mostly full of empty plates, cups and glasses. Lots of gazes and little conversation. After 18 Mins a waiting to see if we might be waited on, we left. No one noticed. The staff was busy preparing a take-out order and completely forgot about the dining room guests. I think some others walked out without paying after trying to with no luck.<br>The good news is that there must be jobs available here. At least in management...<br>We ended up at the El Rinconcito Latino on Bird Road, where we were eating within about 10 mins of our arrival.	0
Ordered a naked (bunless) sliced brisket. A bit dry (needed to be smoked more) and 6 very small (3 inch long or less) thinly sliced pieces weighing less than 1/4 pound total in a carryout clam shell (With a 2 oz portion cup of BBQ sauce on the side) for $7 (plus tax). That's around $30 a pound!	0
A great  overall expierence . The staff, food and atmosphere were outstanding! Highly recommand.	1
The food is pretty good!The service is trash.The stars are sitting comfortably at 2.5.Yelp doesn't allow half stars.The question is: round up or round down?Snooty waitress, slow service, crumb-scattered table, unprofessional everything.I was late for work, because my hour lunch break was up before I finished my food. And there's no way I'm losing my job for Korean chicken wings.So now the question becomes: why not round down?So I round down.	0
Disappointed... And overpriced..Charge extra if u ask for dressing. Or tacos with rice and beans.....	0
Great fish tacos, excellent margaritas, and yummy taquitos! The guacamole was great! Overall, we were very impressed!!!!!!	1
Came here with the family just three days after it opened and everything was perfect! We ordered a ton of appetizers to share, the meatballs were a favorite. The bread they put on the table was delicious. We ordered the gorgonzola mashed potatoes = amazing, the eggplant, chicken parmesan, pasta dishes and more. Everyone was very happy with the service and their meals. Can&#39;t wait to go back, thankfully it&#39;s only three blocks from my condo!	1
Worst customer service ever.. I liked the Monta on Henderson side better ... It&#39;s a small fried rice that we were waiting on for my daughter. we were nearly done eating our ramen and my daughter&#39;s small fried rice still hasn&#39;t come.. The server gave the fried rice to the wrong table.. I found out because the table next to us later then said I never ordered this fried rice... Pathetic! Just lame.. No sorry instead she blamed it on the Chef! Lol wow	0
I have spent MANY a late night here. Not necessarily after going out, but just as a place to hang out and eat good dinner food. Like others have said, the Mac Daddy and Cheese Balls, Bosa Nova Waffle, and Juicy Lucy are solid picks and are amazing. Every other time I go, I get one of these three. The other times, I get this combination: The sauteed spinach (with garlic), cottage cheese, an English muffin, and cup of coffee. Sounds odd, but it's awesome that it's even on the menu.There are a few people that say the service is slow and the food could be cheaper..... why are people in a rush at 3am at night? And what's another dollar for good atmosphere and a welcoming staff? These are people and you're not a king, you don't need instant service. Slow down and enjoy life, you only live once. Anyway, if I had to pick one dinner that I would go to for the rest of my life, this would be it. I have been going here for years and I have built a bond with it that goes deeper than food, it's a place to hang out with friends and waste hours catching up.	1
We've been here before and liked it.  It was the place my wife chose for Valentine's and we were looking forward to it.  The noise level, as could be expected on a crowded night, prohibited normal conversation as everyone around us was shouting.  The food:  my wife's filet mignon was superb, perfectly done.  My choice, the special, a bone in filet mignon, was uneven.  I ordered it medium rare, and the portion closest the bone was almost there.  The outer portion was closer to well done and somewhat pasty.  The sides, however, redeemed it.  We had the lobster mac and cheese and the asparagus.  Wonderful!  As was our server.  We'll likely be back, but not for a while, and NOT on a holiday.	1
I'm embarrassed to admit that in all the years I've lived in LA, Friday evening was my first visit to this dining institution. I'm a fan.We lucked out on parking in a nearby lot and were seated right away when we entered the deli. Score!The waitstaff is friendly, but slow ... which was a-ok because they were speedy with the drinks. There are pickles and sauerkraut to nosh on (to my delight and hubby's disgust) while we waited for our dinner.Hubby enjoyed a French Dip sandwich and I ordered The Marilyn. Both were a-ok. It was a lot of food! What really rocks is the bakery area ... where we went a little nutty and got a ton of stuff to go. The black and white cookies were heavenly, the chocolate rugala was amazing without being too heavy, and the eclair was flaky, fresh, and fantastic. Yes, we pigged out, but it was over the course of a weekend so it's not quite as bad. ;)They still kick it old school with the cash register ... they have a handwritten ledger and an antique register. There are two lines ... one for cash and another for credit. Choose wisely ... they like to keep it orderly.Overall I would definitely be back!	1
I wouldn't have normally chosen to go to dinner here, but a flip of a coin sealed the deal..also, I'm staying at a hotel within walking distance, and the options here are extremely weak. (I wish this trip had me staying in downtown Madison, that place is amazing)	0
I've been here twice for dinner, and both times it was a great experience. I love that it's secluded and if you blink, you'll miss it. The ambiance is fantastic, low lights, nice staff. Great for a b-day dinner with friends, a romantic evening with that special someone. I like that the service was kind of slow. I hate feeling rushed at a restaurant.I can't remember too much about the food because I was drinking. I do remember whatever red wine I had, it was good. I'm definitely going back...	1
On our annual trip to The Orleans, my spouse and I have learned that there is no better restaurant in Las Vegas.  Price, quality, service, and atmosphere is all five star.  On three nights we had filet mignon, lamb chops, scallops, and shrimp which were perfectly prepared and quality cuts.  We could find no fault with the quality of the salads (just order the dressing on the side) or deserts.  Wine values were outstanding and my martini fixed just right.  Service, as always, was impeccable, even when we kept bringing extra people with us.  If something is not good, it only takes a mention and they will make it right.  We hope to be coming back many more years.	1
The food is great we did a rib eye & a sirloin pretty basic cuts, both were done correctly. The mushroom ravioli appetizer is special, the tuna as well...The decor is nice and makes this place a nice one for 'special' dinners. As others have mentioned it is pricey with a good tip for good service we were at $185 for two appetizers, two sides, two steaks and one glass of wine... hummm....	0
First off- Congrats Chef Piero. My co-worker and I shared two sandwiches the cuban and american(the american version of an italian) both delicious.	1
Very friendly indeed. The Pope Francis sandwich is yummy, the Simply Cucumber is mediocre. We also had the Monkey Biz briosh and it was a fun dessert.	1
I've been before and had a wonderful experience, but I won't be back on a Saturday. The place was jammed. First, we had a hard time identifying who our main waiter was, so our request to split the check (two ways) wasn't honored. The sides came on tiny plates and the sides (potatoes) at the market bar were empty on 4 occasions we tried. We waited a long time to be offered the filet mignon when other meats came by 6 times. We tried to order wines and shots and they never came. We weren't charged so not too big of a deal. The gauchos and service staff were lovely and we did enjoy ourselves. I just wouldn't try again on a Saturday night.	0
This place has skyrocketed to my top-five list of Downtown Miami restaurants! The layout of the place and decor are superb, with a modern trendy look that&#39;s also intimate and romantic. VERO&#39;s friendly and welcoming staff members will make you feel at home from the moment you step in. The menu offers a variety of excellent traditional Italian dishes at great prices ($10 lunch menu available), and good portions -- you definitely get what you pay for. The amatriciana sauce with pork belly is a dish you must try! In short, the excellent service and ambiance will turn any common pasta and pizza into a delightful experience with each bite. Welcome to the neighborhood, VERO!	1
I've never had worse service in my entire life. Never offered a refill for starters. But we didn't even see our waitress after she took our initial dinner orders. I mean we saw her just at the tables next to us chatting it up with them getting them refills on drinks pretty much acting as if we were not even there! The food itself was okay I don't particularly get the fawning over this place to be honest. It took them nearly 20 minutes to get our bill to us at which point I reached the boiling point. At no time did the waitress come back to give us the bill a sign of the fact she was either ignoring us on purpose or expecting a lousy tip from us. Normally I am extremely generous with tipping but for the first time in my life I gave Zero. I hate this place. It truly made me feel as if I was worthless garbage. I can only hope the restaurant has karma happen to it. Like patrons ignoring it and being forced to close. Yeah I said it I hope the place closes down	0
So I went here on Monday night for dinner with my better half. Unfortunately dinner was a bargain (thnx to DealPop) but, "more than I bargained for". $3 beers almost alone deserve 2 stars. And their menu is alright. However, I'm %95 sure that they gave me food poisoning, or some other ridiculous 24 hr. stomach virus. The place was sparse, even for a monday. My sweetie and I came down with almost the exact same symptoms 20 hrs after we both ate here. I'll spare the gory details of nights to follow. However, I'm not sure I can comfortably eat here again. Enter at your own risk.	0
the BEST sandwich I have ever had, the halloumi! Absolutely delicious and I rarely eat vegetarian. This is a must try!	1
You guys are insane. This pizza is horrible. I came here with my group after hearing all the hype on yelp only to pay for over priced and over salted mall pizza. The service also left a bad taste in my mouth. Keep this pizza a secret.	0
The food is amazing!!! Make sure to try the al pastor and enjoy a Mexican coke! This is worth the gas to drive across town for me and the service is amazing!!! I will be back definitely!	1
Fantastic location. The Far Bar is behind this narrow little brick alley and entirely outdoors with simple white lights strung across in the air. <br><br>Awesome Happy Hour prices for everything from well drinks, to Asian Beers, to $3 for a huge plate of Wasabi fries and numerous other food items I can&#39;t remember. $6 Bacon Old Fashions. <br><br>Really friendly servers! Oh, and Happy Hour on Monday is 3-Close!!!! Other nights happy hour ends at 7pm. The only thing that prevented them from being 5 stars is the servers were a wee bit slow, but AWESOME!	1
Cooked from great local produce. Simple, clean and delicious.	1
I&#39;ve always experienced excellent customer service before - and the other night was no exception. Friendly, efficient and courteous throughout. <br><br>For starters, we had the oyster and scallop selection. Oysters were good, however a little on the small side. The scallops were prepared well and they went well with the sauce and sides. <br><br>I had the steak special with grilled veggies. Prepared just right and a good sized portion. I didn&#39;t want too much as I wanted to save for dessert (somewhere else). <br><br>My friend opted for the ribs special. Now her meat just slid off the bones. She also asked for mash and I really liked her dish better than mine. <br><br>Both meals were delicious and the staff was awesome. It&#39;s a little on the pricey side however I&#39;d still come back even if I didn&#39;t have a ton of gift cards to use up	1
I was pretty excited to try this place but made the mistake of reading their home page that stated their "dining time" suggestions. 1.5 hours suggested for the 4 course and 2.5 hours for the Chef's tasting menu. As soon as we were seated we felt rushed. I tried to slow things down by ordering a cocktail before opening the menu but the waiter was very insistent. I ordered the 4 course prix fix with wine pairing. I wasn't even finished with my cocktail before the Sommelier poured my first taste of Riesling. She continued to pour for the next course before we finished the course we were on. Rushed. We finished and had 17 minutes to spare....The food was delicious, the wine was delicious however things could have been slowed down just a step or two	0
I visited Jjanga back when it was Kanji for sushi. This time we came for Hibachi on Valentine&#39;s Day. We did not make a reservation so it was a miracle a party of six was able to make it to hibachi within 30 minutes. We had an awesome hibachi chef. He was hilarious and put on an awesome show. Our food was great and there was no shortage! The house sangria is delicious and so is the house made sake sampler. We also did 2 rounds of sake bombs! I personally think it tastes better with plain cold sake but the flavored isn&#39;t too bad either. Benja is awesome and took great care of us!	1
This hip restaurant is located in a posh and industrial enclave of DTLA. Take two steps in the wrong direction and you might find yourself face to face with a belligerent transient (true story). The Biscuit building is filled with impressive lofts that makes you feel like you're in some European metropolis. The Lavender honey goat cheese appetizer is well worth the visit to Church & State. It's creamy texture with floral after tones left a sweet memory in my mind.The roasted marrow bone was very rich. Although, the pickled radish added the necessary acidity to cut through the fat, I wish this dish had more flavor to make it memorable to me. I liked that the mussels came with fries. However, after reading that the fries were frozen, it lost a certain appeal. Some of the mussels had a fishy smell to it which was a bit of a turnoff...and the broth didn't have enough flavor for me. i wouldn't order this again. The caramelized scallops were delicious. I loved the multi-colored cauliflowers. Some were pickled and some roasted. All in all this dish was well prepared and lovely to eat.	1
Oh what a glorious view. I'm a sucker for a high perch overlooking our splendid city. This habitat is very inviting for a beautiful LA crowd. Fashion plates, actress/model types are abound with the handsome gents running closely after them. I came stag and there were plenty of choices peruse. I'm a male-watcher. If I wanted to watch whales, I would be in Monterey Bay or at the local dive bar. This is neither. OK, so I found parking in front at 8:10 PM on a Saturday night. I didn't valet but this place definitely has the glamour points to warrant it- but if the parking gods smile upon me, I don't turn it down and make them frown. Open the double glass doors into a stark ,modern, chic yet tiny entry/lobby of the hotel. Take elevator to 6th floor. Then take another elevator to the roof- voila! You're instantly transported away into the roof walkway entry where there was no one at the maitre'd station. I whizzed over to the bar (I can always sniff one out at any locale) which was tiny but had seats. I ordered the cucumber, mint refreshing vodka cocktail- ordered mine with Goose. Why ruin a perfectly good cocktail with shitty vodka? They said I could smoke there. So I lit up. Then the bartender kindly clarified, "OK, anywhere but at the bar..." Oh, NYC sophistication went out the door. I really miss bars that let you smoke. Oh well, more impetus to survey my surrounds. Oh, what surroundings! The pool glistened under a nascent moon- big, clear and lemon yellow filtered from our perpetual smog. The city gleamed with vivid colors reflecting from our shiny modern architecture, the skyline was just perfect. The weather was just so right on- not too cold but with a cool breeze to remind you that we live in a desert where it does cool off significantly compared to the sweltering days. I sighed with heavy breath as I fondly gazed upon this plain Jane of a town, which under these drastic makeover environs, looked like a billion bucks of glittering gems piled and strewn across a thick, ashen, black velvet backdrop. David Yurman doesn't have anything on this dazzling, illuminated gemstone of a city!My girl showed up a few minutes following with exact cue as I had just completed my lap around the roof passing the pool, the sunken deck complete with outdoor cozy furnishings and a giant, ubiquitous glass beaded gas burning fire pit the size of an impressive aquarium. Back up a short set of stairs to the masses around the pool, sipping their cocktails elegantly as they could barely contain the same appreciation I had for this magnificent view. My friend and I sauntered around for a bit as I was more than gleeful to show her just what I had seen a few second ago. We sat at a few high boy seats with a table away from the throngs of nocturnal beauties, it was perfect for the coterie of appetizers that we wanted to order and the miles of conversation we had ahead of us. We had the spicy sweet chicken wings (not our fave), baked potato fries (our clear favorite) and the charcuterie plate. She had a fruity drink which was winning my heart but alas, I had already fallen for the tart, refreshing drink in my hand. It was just the perfect amount of food for 2 girls catching up on decades of memories over a few cigarettes and libations. Staff was attentive and sincerely courteous. I plan to make this home base this season. Oh and they have brunch here- already dreaming of it. Highly recommended. This is what LA is about.	1
2 for $20 is still a great deal. A lot of TVs made it nice to watch the Badgers in the Big 10 championship game. Aubrey P. was a great server. Overall a great meal out!!	0
Sat at table for 15 minutes while the three waiters stayed behind the bar and kept their backs to us and the entire restaurant, occasionally turning around to stare right at us and still not take our order. I waved my arms enthusiastically at the three of them whenever they turned around. The place was not busy at all...they just didn&#39;t care. They didn&#39;t even see us walk out.	0
Mike the manager was very rude to one of his employees. He yelled at her and everyone could hear him	0
Manager directed employees to release hundreds of New Years balloons onto the street for someone else to clean up wherever they land. Regardless of the food or drink, this is a shameful way to run a business.	0
Kalgooksoo here is legit!<br><br>There are several varieties, but it seems the seafood and the chicken knife-cut noodles are the best. You can get the super-sized version, which can feed more than 4 people. If you want to try something other than kalgooksoo, the teji bulgogi isn&#39;t a bad option either. <br><br>Prices are inexpensive and food is great, but service can be lacking at times and banchan is limited.	1
UDPATE: I gave this restaurant another try and the mussels were raunchy and rancid and I found hairs in my french fries!!! Gross!!!<br><br>I so so wanted to give this restaurant a 4 or 5 star rating, however, I simply cannot based on the poor level of service I recieved from the moment I walked in the door to the moment I left.<br><br>We had an 8 p.m. reservation for 3 people and when i had called to make the reservation, I had requested outdoor seating. I was told that the patio outside was on a first come first serve basis only, so we might have to wait a little. No problem. We arrived, and were told our table was getting ready. We wait 20 minutes; it&#39;s going on 8:30. I run over and ask if we can just sit outside to make it quicker and the hostess explains that there is a private party and the patio is reserved all night. I was a confused because I was told something earlier on the phone, but let it go.<br><br>We were finally seated at almost 9 p.m. Our waitress was unattentive. She stopped by once at the beginning of our meal to take our orders. She did not run the food to our table and she didn&#39;t stop by at all to check in for drinks, how our meal was, etc. When she did finally make it around, she did not ask how our meal was, she did not offer us coffee or dessert and she was in such a hurry to get away from the table. She dropped off our check and another 20 minutes passed before we waved someone else down to actually take our check to run it. I think it was the manager, but he was mousy, didn&#39;t ask how our evening was and just took the check and ran off in an instant. <br><br>On a brighter note, the food is well prepared and very delicous. The goat cheese fondue was fantastic and to be honest, this was one of the better burgers I&#39;ve had in Los Angeles in general. Also, the Mojito cocktail was out of this world. My friend had another Luna Park speciality cocktail and it was fantastic as well. If I was rating on food/drink alone, they surely would get a higher rating. <br><br>The atmosphere is something I really enjoy - low lit, loud&#34;ish&#34; music and a happening bar inside the restaurant. I don&#39;t enjoy disturbing other diners with my conversations or vice versa in a quiet restaurant. Luna Park delivers in food and atmosphere...If only they could find a semi-friendly staff to match....	0
I used to love Canter's. I live in San Diego and it is kind of a long drive to get there. Took my nephews out to eat and had the worst service EVER! I tried to call Lynn this morning and was told "she comes in later" and the guy that answered the phone just hung up! Huh? Our waitress was rude, slow and was saying snarky remarks when we were leaving. Seems like the service is definitely something they need to work with. Never saw a manager so no on really helped us when we waited 30 minutes for refills. When we wanted her to put our order in for a sandwich she told us we had to order that upfront. So, I am going to eat my meal and then wait upfront for 15 minutes for a sanddwich. I paid $40 ffor two meals and drinks. If I am going to pay that much I sure as heck don't expect to deal with a waitress that is miserable and rude. It was obvious.My sister wanted to go to another deli but it was closed. Don't know if I would be back. It's sad because some of the servers are really nice. There should be someone walking around to make sure tables are taken care of....	0
I love this place! I have been to Jaks several times and have always been more than satisfied with what I order. 	1
Jesus christ what a $#!T#0!3. Enter at your own risk and be prepared to be trampled by the high horses of ex-frat bros and sorority girls who never grew up, then have your body carried away in a sea of entitlement, along with your wallet if you order any of their overpriced fare.	0
Great BBQ flavor. Their faux chicken is remarkably close to the real thing.	1
Great Beer Selection, Great Wings, Mostly Bad Service, Horrible Management.	0
Has this place gotten better? Just a tad bit. The employees are still very friendly, but the food still lacks flavor. The pita was better this time.	0
AMBIANCE/ENVIRONMENT: nice evening view of downtown LA skylines, similar to Standard.<br>SERVICES: good<br>FOOD: drinks are good/decent<br>RECOMMENDATION: a weeknight spot for a date, weekend spot for group hanging out, classy get together spot.	1
Try their new summer menu, cho gae gook soo, it&#39;s the bomb! Loved their pa kimchi and jji gae the jji gae was awesome! Definitely going back there.	1
Cute little pizza and gelato shop at the axis next to what used to be the hoxton. Im not a big pizza fan but they serve up some good ones. Service is decent and courteous except there is a major language barrier. Unless you speak spanish, it is hard to communicate... You would think English would be mandatory since we are in the United States. Other then that they are nice.<br><br>Meat lover pizza (5/5) crispy yummy crust with yummy decent distribution of toppings.<br><br>Healthy and spicy pizza (4/5) no cheese light veggie pizza. it was good but I like it with more sauce.<br><br>pizzanezza for two (4/5) roommate loved this but I find it a heart attack waiting to happen.<br><br>chicken wings (4/5) pretty good and not overly sauced.<br><br>Calamari (3/5) crispy but bland<br><br>Gelato (4/5) creamy but a little too sweet for me<br><br>overall my pizza place of choice and they do have a good selection of gelato favor made fresh.	1
I saw this place listed on more than one list of the "best burgers in LA". So while I was driving around looking for something to cure a hangover and passed by it I knew I had to stop. I'm glad I did. First off the burger-it's good-it's really good. I don't know if it is in fact one of the best in LA but it's pretty right on-the bun and the onions are amazing. The fries however-are in fact nearly impossible to beat. The service was awesome and I have to mention at this point that they waitresses looked as if they were cast for the role of "hot hollywood waitress/aspiring famous something or the other"-all of them ridiculously hot. I know I know-it's not about hot waitresses it's about the food but damn....good stuff.	1
Stopped by today because they have frozen custard. Los Angeles needed a place with frozen custard and man have we scored! The frozen custard was sooooo good that I felt like a kid in the back seat of a station wagon on a Midwestern summer evening. The sandwiches looked good but I had just had lunch so next time will try one. But I am coming back for the frozen custard anyway.	1
The food, wine pairing, and wait staff made the entire evening pleasurable and extremelya wonderful dining experience.	1
I would compare their food, service, and presentation to that of a concentration camp. <br><br>I went because of the long lines I would see, and it was probably the worst decision I ever made.<br><br>Save your money, time and appetite, and go to Denny&#39;s or IHOP instead.<br><br>Or for the best breakfast in LA try BLD, hands down the best!	0
In the 3 weeks I was in LA I went here twice and came out both times satisfied and full. They served me up a perfect reuben that was good enough for two meals (it was still excellent 4 hours later). The second time I had an excellent mishmosh soup. I love how huuuuge their matzoh balls are! My mom's were never that huge. I wish their prices weren't quite so steep, but hey us Jews gotta paid too. If I ever get to go here again I'm going to buy some of that delicious looking rugelach!	1
Me and my husband are staying the night at the double tree hotel for our last night on our honeymoon before we fly back home tomorrow afternoon. Both of us love sushi and we&#39;re excited to order out and get back to the hotel room with a bottle of wine. We placed a to go order in the, compared to the alluring outside dining area, run down takeout area and made our way back to our hotel room. $37 for four typical rolls (2 cali, 1 spicy tuna, 1 volcano) with a proclaimed sushi chef in the kitchen- we just knew we were getting something good... When we opened our sushi the first thing we noticed was the smell, a mixture of BO and a sub shop worker after a long night. But, they served other things besides sushi, so we plunged forward. My new Husband poped a roll in his mouth, looked at me, and spit It out. I laughed at him, and asked &#34;It can&#39;t be that bad?&#34; But the answer... Was it was not bad. It was terriable. The imitation crab tasted more imitation bad, and the absolute worst I&#39;ve ever ever had. The worst part was that every single item that made up the sushi roll tasted like it was imitation down to the sesame seeds they topped everything off with. My husband ended up throwing up all night. Thank you, NoVo Sushi for the epic ending to my honeymoon. <br><br>There are alot of good reviews on this place, which is why I&#39;m confused. We may just be Sushi Snobs, but this place... the answer is just dont. The Burger King down the road would have been a safer bet.	0
ughhhhhhmmmmm, interesting. friend of a friend suggested this place cuz it is his favorite, and he lived a really long time in tokyo, so he must know right? um, no, not really. we ordered shoyu and spicy garlic tonkatsu...with additional veggie toppings and sides of fried chicken... and it was just super duper disappointing! the broth is kinda bland and not thick like i expect tonkatsu to be.. BLEHhhhhHh. oh then, the fried chicken is very super duper lacking in flavor! so sad, cuz i was really looking forward to it since i ran a lot in the morning to eat it. MEEPS. will not be coming back, especially making the trek from soma..	0
So I&#39;ve been here a few times since I live down the street, and it&#39;s been usually a very delicious experience, but the last time my boyfriend and I were there we saw a rat behind the bar. Told one of the workers, who spent all of 2 seconds looking for it, and then kind of brushed us off. So that&#39;s pretty disgusting and we probably won&#39;t be coming back.	0
Super slow service, mediocre tacos and the worst cole slaw I&#39;ve ever had :/	0
Why are they so poorly run? Always out of the biscuits, can't get orders right, it seems like this is the first job any of them have had? The service is horrible. It is so odd because it is hugely successful as it is packed. I am happy they are here because I am local and we are desperate for something like this here. Just want them to please get their act together so hoping this yelp will wake someone up. Please? I want to love you Precita Cafe! Please whomever owns this place help!!!!!!	0
My boyfriend's favorite type of food is French, he also has an affinity for LA sky lines. When I heard about Perch... I couldn't help but think it was a PERFECT place to take him for his birthday! Let me just say, it was a little far from perfect. I made reservations about a month in advance. Only to get there and have them tell me if I want to sit outside I have to wait an hour. I guess inside it is. So we sit down at a coffee table with two huge chairs on either side of it. More of a longue- drink- bar hour feel to it. Wasn't exactly the "nice dinner" experience I was going for. But it wasn't a big deal, I was going to make the best out of it!Then comes time for food...We order the Lobster Bisque and Baked Brie. Lobster Bisque--not good. At all. I literally think I could probably prepare a better Bisque. Baked Brie on the other hand- DELICIOUS! And I know for a fact I could never emulate that. So as for appetizers, it was definitely and HIT OR MISS. Not really what you expect for the price.As for main course, I ordered the Salmon Caviar and my boyfriend ordered the Braised Short Rib. My salmon was just okay. I would never ever pay 30 dollars for that again. And the Braised Short Rib wasn't anything to rave about either. It was boring, I think I could have ordered it ANYWHERE. We both came into the meal expecting A LOT and left.. feeling disappointed. I honestly would not recommend this place if you are looking for good food. If you want a view of a gorgeous skyline, sure. Just make sure you're willing to wait a while.	0
I&#39;ve been here a couple of times and it is great if you want to get something good and fast. You stand by the bar, so do not expect to spend a lot of time here. They cook right in front of you so it is a pretty cool experience too. The restaurant is owned by the same people that own Basta Pasta.<br><br>We have literally tried almost everything on their menu and everything is so good. The service here is also pretty good.	1
I went there Sunday early evening and had an awesomely delicious meal! I had read all the reviews listed and decided I had to give this place a try. 	1
I normally don&#39;t like giving a 5 star review off the bat but WOW! <br><br>At first I was kinda nervous about the food since it came out within minutes after we ordered. But the food looked fresh, colorful, and tasty so we dug in. My head started nodding in agreement with my gf as we were inhaling the food, without even speaking we both knew that En Hakkore is a new Go-To spot. <br><br>We ordered the Bi-Bim Bap with Korean BBQ Beef and the Paratha Tacos with Spicy Pork. The Bi Bim Bap serves two easily. Squeeze some of their homemade hot sauce in the bowl and mix and mix until everything is coated then dig in! The bowl has so many flavors going on that compliment one another it&#39;s fantastic. The tacos also have a ton of flavor going on with the kimchi, onion, sesame seeds, cilantro, and pickled radish. The &#34;tortilla&#34; is similar to a scallion pancake minus the scallions. Thicker than a tortilla and very tasty. <br><br>Great place for delicious food at a very reasonable price. You order at the cashier then they bring out your food within minutes to a table of your choice. Nice staff and clean place. <br><br>I may move to the area for this place...	1
Dotty's is famous for their burgers in Madison, Wisconsin. A simple recipe burger consisting of a beef patty, crispy bacon, cheddar, and a sesame bun focuses on the trifecta of meat, carbs, and cheese. The burger will definitely satisfy a burger craving (or the college appetite), however it lacks the polish to make it famous too much further than Madison. A softer bun, juicier beef, and a more mouthwatering combination of flavors with some punch from sauce/salt/vinegar could put this simple burger on the national map.	0
A Caracas this is NOTTT. <br><br>Came here for dinner once with five others, and therefore sampled a mixture of drinks, arepas and entrees. I crashed this party late, and therefore do not know the names of the food I tasted... but names are not necessary!<br><br>Cocotero is your typical Chelsea haunt, with colorful walls and dim lighting, almost DARK, at night (though I&#39;ve walked by this restaurant many times before and noticed that it is rather dark and empty inside during the day.)<br><br>The drinks are okay. The drinks were not too strong; the sangria was almost sweet, and the mango/rum thing my friend had - well, what rum? But the food was sadly average. The meat served with the entrees was not worth it; the shredded chicken over rice was bland, and the beef and pork belly in the other entree was extremely tough. The arepas were unremarkable as well; the saucy chicken especially one was overwhelmed with sauce, as if the cook just slathered sauce over some chicken cubes without bothering to cook. <br><br>All in all, mehhhh. Quality of food isn&#39;t worth a return trip.	0
Much needed in belltown!	1
1 star is too much. Just had the most negligent service. Hostess had to serve us. No menu for food was offered, we were COMPLETELY ignored. Shame considering the price of the drinks warrants a modicum of service. Won&#39;t be going back. Good luck, Stark.	0
Not too much going on. I chose it because it was busy. Hot tea is included. For $9.50 I got miso ramen with tasty broth and one piece of pork, 3 thin pieces of bamboo, half a hard-boiled egg that was still a bit cool, green onions, and noodles. Didn't really seem like much for the money. Waitress indifferent and didn't check in with me after delivering food. I wouldn't bother.	0
This place is a bit schizophrenic.I am staying at the hotel for a week so I am here enough to say that they serve a good breakfast with a friendly breakfast staff.	0
I LOOOOVE this place. I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes the service is a little on the slow side, so I&#39;m holding out on my 5th star. The wine selection is great and the sandwiches are yummy!	1
Nice chill bar with great beer and good food! Great for happy hour. It's outdoors, and you walk through a small alley.There isn't a huge sign so not that easy to find. Across the miyako hotel. The parking attendant was very nice to let me park there for cheap since I told him i'd be back before 10. Very cute and intimate. Bring a sweater if you get cold easily. Been here a few times with bigger groups and it's still not too crazy crowded. (and this place is small) Great mix of people, nice music sometimes live. I went 2 months ago on a wednesday, had the HOTS buger and wasabi fries both delicious! Love the spice! Though I think I kept tasting that garlic wasabi the next day too!	1
Why so serious?	0
Great pie. I walked in to the friendliest lady behind the counter. It was the nicest greeting I&#39;ve ever had in my life. I didn&#39;t ask for her name, but you will know who she is when you come in. My pie was great, just right. Wasn&#39;t too sweet, wasn&#39;t sloppy, right moisture, perfect crust. Had a conversation with the owner, and he sorta taught me a little about pies. Great experience. I wish i had a bigger appetite, i would have bought more. I just went there to kill time and eat something sweet to satisfy my pallets. No regrets.	1
We went to Perch last night. It&#39;s definitely more of a social, bar-type place than a real restaurant. We had made a reservation a week in advance and when we arrived we were seated outside, but had to ask to be re-seated twice because the waiters kept walking by and hitting our table ( nearly dropping HOT food on us!) <br>They forgot to give us bread, which wouldn&#39;t have been such an issue had the food not taken an hour to arrive. We ordered the asparagus salad, the steak frites and the Beouf pot au feu. The salad was nothing special. The steak frites came with frites with truffle oil but they were completely soggy and while they tasted fine, they really were a nasty texture. The pot au feu was nice, the horseradish mashed potatoes were STRONG and the peas were super dry, most defiantly frozen. We had the pot au creme and berries with whipped cream for dessert which was lovely. Overall, it was pretty disappointing. It gets very loud and crowded after 8ish so enjoying dinner can be tricky. Overpriced, overrated. Best recommended for drinks..although those weren&#39;t amazing either. Put simply, your paying for the view. <br><br>**the decor is sort of wonky, a little bizarre the restaurant floor looks more like the cafe in Friends than anything French...a bit cheesy<br><br>Try the bar at the Standard for a more refined experience, or the Water Grill for an amazing meal!	0
Long wait outside and another long wait for service of a mediocre meal. The chicken was too salty, the Catfish was lost<br>somewhere inside of the overbearing breading, with a dollop of Tartar sauce on top. Seriously? Mac and cheese was served with a dash of hot sauce on top. Who does that? One of our party ordered Chicken biscuits and deserts to go, only to find that the deserts were not included in the take out order. They don&#39;t remember if they were charged for them or not. As far as I&#39;m concerned, the entire meal should have been comped.	0
Five stars for the truffle burger. It's is so flavorful and juicy and everything a burger described as umami should be!!!~Came in for the happy hour, grabbed a beer and the trio sampler of mini burgers. I LOVE mini things, they are just so damn cute. And what better way to sample a few of the different burgers Umami has to offer? So since the truffle burger is definitely number one on my list, I would say next out of the three is the Hatch burger, and then the manly burger. All three of them were tasty, but that's only if I HAD to put the min any particular order heehee.	1
Service and food was excellent the spice was just right. We had a little of everything chicken, goat and beef . We will most definitely be back!!!!! Rice pudding was awesome!	1
Staff is stuffy to the point of rude! Very unpleasant experience.	0
While I was walking around downtown la looking for food to have for my lunch.. And this guy seen me looking at the menu and said come to our place its very good and all the things that he was naming sound great.. So I had tried chicken burger wit the side of fries.. Once I bite into the burger it was soo amazing I just couldn&#39;t stop eating until when it was all gone.. I like that they had the pics of the food next their was the name of it.. Really good	1
Went here for the 1st time looking for the best chicken soup in Midtown. Sadly to say it wasn&#39;t the best chicken soup but it was good vegetable soup. There was literally a shred of chicken in my soup. Although I was disappointed, I had to admit the broth, rice and veggies were tasty. I figured since I trekked 4 ave&#39;s down, I&#39;d go all out and order a soup, sandwich and dessert. So I ordered the rotisserie sandwich on a whole wheat baguette and added spice. It was sooo good! The bottom of the bread soaks up the juices nicely while staying crusty on top. there was plenty of chicken and potatoes packed in. Its a nice clean flavorful sandwich and is worth the price. Lastly I had the carrot cake. I was a tad bit sad there was no cream cheese frosting but you can see that its a dense moist piece of yummy goodness. It didn&#39;t disappoint! I am writing this review fully content. Overall my order came out to $21.18 which is a bit pricey but the quality of the food at hand is unquestionable. Chicken Provence is a nice little spot. The food was prompt, well packaged and the service was great.	1
i love going here! they serve Eagle Rock Brewery beer (which i love) and are always pretty friendly.we usually sit at the bar to eat and usually get the same thing.we'll start with their bread plate- amazing!! then get the caesar salad- amazing!and then, the best of all- the pepperoni pizza! i go to a lot of pizza joints and this has to be one of the best out there. i've heard their brunch is good too but i just keep going back for the pizza!!see you guys again soon!	1
Great patio, service and chicken sandwich! Very stroller friendly as well - no surprise on Southport but still appreciated.	1
Almost every time I eat at Marigold, I walk away unsatisfied. It's one of those places that some of my friends love, but is simply just not for me.	1
Awesome service, Awesome food...you may call it the bomb, I call it NUCLEAR. .. I will be back...	1
I was really in the mood for some BBQ, but did not know where to go so I did a little Google searching for a place and found People&#39;s Bar-B-Que with a lot of positive reviews. Good reviews and the fact that it was in the hood, I decided to go there because those things must mean that they had authentic BBQ.<br><br>The reviews I read were mostly great, but it definitely couldn&#39;t be because of the service (the girl at the counter couldn&#39;t get my order right and had attitude) or the atmosphere (plain and basic), it had to be because of the food.<br><br>After a bit of a wait, I finally got my food (ribs and chicken, however I ordered only ribs). It was pretty average BBQ, although the sauce would not be described as a typical BBQ sauce. The sauce had a surprisingly nice taste and flavor though. I was just a little annoyed eating the ribs because they were randomly chopped (not by each rib) and the sauce was excessive (I got some on my clothes). The sides were pretty decent.<br><br>Basically it was good but I doubt I would ever go back. The unique sauce made it interesting, but other than it was pretty standard.	0
Some of the worst food I&#39;ve ever eaten. First let me start by saying that the wait time to order our drinks was approx 15 mins. My date had to go find menus and let the waitress know that once again we&#39;re here. The food awful. The greens were salty and tasted like they&#39;re straight from a can, and if they&#39;re not, I have to say that someone has a special skill if they can make a collard green taste that bad. The cornbread dressing was a stiff blob of something with once again gravy that appeared to be from a jar or a can. The cabbage was the saving grace but for the fact that it had very little seasoning. The fried chicken was inconsistent, the wings were a tad greasy but weren&#39;t dried out like the chicken breast. The mac n cheese tastes like it looks, like dried paste. Look at the pictures that are posted they will tell you everything you need to know. There is no love and definitely no soul used in making the food at M&amp;M. Don&#39;t waste your time.	0
About 3 months ago, I had to come out to LA for a work event and due to the insane hours we were working, there was not much time to go around LA and explore the eating choices. One of my coworkers kept telling me about this place and how even though it doesn&#39;t look much, this place has some amazing food choices, specifically the pancakes. So after listening to his recommendation, I went here a total of 3 times during my week long stay in LA, and every time, I felt completely full thanks to their generous portions and completely satisfied, both from good food and great service. Now, 3 months later, I still find myself dreaming of their soft and fluffy pancakes. I can&#39;t wait until my next visit to LA because this will definitely be a spot I hit up, especially since it&#39;s open 24 hours!!!	1
The service, staff, and quality of food is always &quot;outstanding&quot; at Cafe Fleuri!  I have been a loyal diner at Cafe Fleuri for over 10 years!  And, I will continue to dine and introduce this &quot;gem&quot; to friends and associates!	1
Beyond disappointed!!! <br>The sandwiches we ordered tried to be special but only succeeded in having distracting seasonings and mediocre flavor.<br>We ordered the meatball sandwich-- ehhh... Meatball seasoning was not particularly good, the sauce was mediocre at best.<br>We also ordered the Hot Chicken Panini.... The calabrese chile became overpowering to the flavor of chicken and bacon...<br>The drinks were all extremely overpriced cans or bottles... Not even a glass of water available:(<br>I will not be returning.	0
Ridiculously good food. A plethora of yummy food options and an extensive beer selection. Such a fun and tasty take on micheladas and popsicles for dessert. The place has great energy. And they have board games. No one rushes you to leave. AND, most importantly, the staff is really friendly. The last time I went, the kitchen was having an off day (my corn was served cold and it took forever to get my nachos), BUT the hostess and waitress came over to us separately and were so sincerely apologetic, and they offered us a round on the house to compensate us for the inconvenience. I really appreciated their responsiveness and the gesture. Diablo remains one of my favorite LA &#34;go to&#34; restaurants.	1
I was told not to review chain restaurants, but this one needs better ratings.	0
I only ever eat here for Taco Tuesday&#39;s! But their tacos and taco salads are really good and it is a great price too!<br><br>Since my work offices are right around the corner, it is a great cheap lunch to look forward too!<br><br>I believe it is 2 tacos for 99 cents and taco salad is only $2.99 (but don&#39;t quote me, you can definitely get out of there with a meal under $5). . .<br><br>I prefer the taco salad!	1
Gritz Cafe is great. Went there and tried the Fried Catfish...hmmmm ..good. One of the best soul food place around. Highly recommended!!!	1
I read a lot of the reviews before going there and was a bit nervous. After going, I'm not sure if I just went on a good day/time or what. Service was really good, the pretzels were amazing and the quesadilla was really good too. Being a fan of micro-brew beer i found the beer to be pretty good too. Overall it was a good experience and I will be back! One extra bonus is that on Sunday's it's happy hour all day, $3 beers and $6 apps!!!	0
This place is sooo dialed in!<br><br>The space is very unique. Walk up deli coffee ice cream part and the dining, out door patio part. Super cool concept, Only had a coffee which I&#39;m very picky and the dark roast was perfect!! Made on the spot. Menu still limited, But Hudson House has been in my top ten for years so I am sure thre ffod is up to par	1
My family and I are new here and we frequent Puerto Rico and the cuisine is a great reminder of all the memories made on the island. If you are looking for great food and wonderful service give this place a try.	1
Great happy hour, thoughtful dishes and nice decor. Brought the parents here after a successful date night. Love, love, love the Rose Sake.	1
Ugh, I had such high hopes for this place because of all the gushing reviews but I'd have to classify our dining experience as a FAIL! The service staff was cold and robotic, and the only person who asked us about if we were enjoying the food was the busser who cleared our entree plates. Our server couldn't be bothered after he gave his spiel about the restaurant and its decor changes. The food was ok but unmemorable (although I loved my smoked chowder), and the cocktails were good not amazing (my old fashioned was so overwhelmingly citrus it made me nauseous).I'm really tired of restaurants that rely SO heavily on the local buzz and their short reputations that they let their service fall by the wayside. Lame!	0
LOVE the service and the chicken bowl is delicious. The sauces and onion stuff that they have next to the sodas taste amazing with the food. This place has become my new obsession!	1
Amazing food and service, true to the BLT name...strange setting at the Bally's though.	1
After reading all of the latest reviews, we though to chime in about the service and just about the overall decor and vibe of the place. The food my boyfriend and I had (steak and a curry dish) were okay. Not out of this world.<br>Our friends with us had a sucky dish that was &#34;pork belly sludge&#34;. We tasted it to confirm it was gross and overwhelming and not what was described on the menu. <br>I could deal with so-so food, but for the price, they need to get some things seriously together.<br>For one, the Williamsburg transplant hostess was beyond rude. I&#39;ve been living in this neighborhood for 14 years kid, don&#39;t front people when you take the job of a hostess. Go back to working at American Apparel.<br>Also, I&#39;ve never been so annoyed as the waitress and the wierdo hostess coming outta nowhere, trying to take our plates away not one, but 3!!!! times, before we were finished. It just became obnoxious and the owners need to have a pow wow about service, booking, and the decor...which was pathetic. At least darken up the dismall foyer, entry way and get rid of the sad home depot mix of service stands at the end of the hall.<br>The place is half assed.	0
Great atmosphere and ambiance, I really liked that the bar is pretty spacious and they have those great big window/doors right in the of the restaurant by the bar, very airy, love that. <br><br>I had to give them 4 starts because of their limited menu and they are not very vegetarian friendly and do not have many food options. They do have a great wine selection which I can appreciate. If you are looking for a great place to just chill with a friend with a great glass of wine and some starters they are awesome.	1
Four stars? Five stars? Get real. This place was *not* good. NOT good.<br><br>I came here on the advice of reviews and it&#39;s one of the first times that Yelp failed me. I sat in the Garden Room, made reservations, ordered what people recommended. Total fail.<br><br>The service was brusque, the food was seriously terrible. Bland, poorly cooked, just bad. Maybe the Garden Room is better during the summer, but it was just horrible.<br><br>I honestly can&#39;t fathom how anyone gave this place more than 3 stars. Maybe I caught it on an off day (but I doubt it). Sure, it&#39;s cute, and it&#39;s nice to have a cute little restaurant in an &#34;off the beaten track&#34; location, but that cuteness doesn&#39;t make up for how much it actually sucks.<br><br>Sorry guys.	0
Loooove this place! The baristas are great and really know what they're doing and happy to talk about how they make they're great coffee! Can't say enough great things!	1
People, there is simply no such thing as an amazing panini. Americans demand oily sandwiches without too much flavor that might otherwise disrupt a quick, almost athletic ingestion. And that&#39;s why we tolerate such middling, cheesy-stuffed meats, a gooey business between two slices of grill-marked bread that bears no real difference in flavor from the cloth napkins used to wipe away the crumbs.<br><br>Let the airports have their greasy paninis and leave the rest of American cuisine alone!<br><br>There is nothing here that cannot be cooked more healthily and tastefully at home. The tomato bisque had far too much cream; the tuna crostini was served crudely with ingredients that tasted the same as their canned equivalents; and the arugula salad came drenched in rendered bacon fat. In all the dishes we sampled, I could not distinguish the flavors of the specific ingredients listed with each menu item from the heavy oil and milk-fat substrates that the chefs deemed necessary to make our meal palatable.<br><br>The only reason why I can imagine so many people write favorably about this place is that they&#39;re conflating the texture and satiation they feel while eating with the range of flavors they&#39;d expect from a &#34;casual&#34; but &#34;hip&#34; dining experience.<br><br>Il Bambino will make you feel very full, but only an army of Yelp reviewers will make you feel good about it.	0
The best pizza around.	1
5 stars for food. The food is excellent and the menu is diverse. We had causitas, which were interesting and delicious but defy explanation. Try them!! We also had pollo saltado and the chicken sandwich, which both used high quality ingredients and were presented beautifully. Seriously, the presentation at this place rivals the most upscale restaurant in any city. Obviously, there is a true chef in the kitchen who takes real pride in the food being served. It is amazing.	0
I paid $16 for a chicken burrito with a small side of guacamole. Rip off. Burrito was 80% beans and rice. And the chicken was chewy and hard. Definitely would not recommend.	0
A place of peace and quiet.. I had doubts of this place when I checked yelp but I&#39;m glad I came here. The waitress here is very friendly and believed to be family owned. Great customer service, you never have to ask for any refills And they even give alot of specials..<br><br>I really recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a Vietnamese And Korean fusion restaurant..best in ktown in my experience	1
I was in the mood for Chinese food and after calling a 2-3 other restaurants to see if they accepted Discover cards, I found that Canton Star did! I ordered Honey Chicken, Pork Fried Rice, Wonton Soup, Crab Rangoon, and an egg roll. Basically a feast. everything was delicious and the delivered the food to my house within 20 minutes so my hungry tummy wasn&#39;t complaining! i recommend this place highly! You can easily feed 3 people with a dinner combination.	1
Best Philly cheesesteak and whiz fries. Simply delicous. Big fan :) If you have a problem eating by the sidewalk, just take it to go. Tooo good to say pass .	1
Very homey restaurant have to say the food was darn good I had the pork shoulder jam I mean I wouldn&#39;t even think it would be that good but it was excellent my drink on the other side was not so great don&#39;t remember what is was but it was slacking on taste should of just got the coke and rum for desert I had the drunken toast which actually live up to its name it was soak in alcohol and I enjoy the crap out of it it the service was great no complaints there and it was good it was really good I will be back	1
Place was empty and food was mediocre, but worst thing was the online menu has lower prices than in the restaurant. This is very deceptive and its too bad there are no laws around this. In this day in age, it takes 5 minutes to update a website so this is clearly deceptive to get you in the door. $17 to $20 is not a huge deal, but principle of it bugs me. Pasta dishes were okay but I've had better elsewhere.	0
reviews deceived med-- especially those from californians who claimed to have found a good NY pho spot<br><br>the &#34;Meh. I&#39;ve experienced better.&#34; designated by the 2-star score is pretty on point.<br><br>will happily pick another potentially mediocre-to-good-enough vietnamese spot next time	0
I eat here every time I am in Seattle for work - the food has always been wonderful and the staff is pleasant and helpful. Great Indian restaurant!	1
Cool atmosphere! Yummy drinks. Worst toasted cheese sandwich I have ever tasted and unfortunately really poor service?!	0
The food tasted good and was a good value. The service was good as well.	1
This is a great place for lunch! The salmon was exquisite, service was impeccable and the wine selection was world class! Be sure to have the 19th hole chocolate peanut butter dessert. Fabulous!	1
I only gave two stars because I&#39;m certain that the food poisoning causing me to leave work early and miss out on done great money, came from here. I ordered the Caesar salad with Salmon, the toughest piece of salmon that I ever had in my life but best tasting Caesar salad I had ever had. That was the only thing I had eaten yesterday so it really disappointed me because as tasty as it was, I&#39;m afraid to go back. I thought I had found a nice little lunch spot but as I lay here with my tummy still haywire.... I simply just cringe. First impressions, hopefully I&#39;m able to stomach going back one day and give them another chance to make it right. Atmosphere and taste 5 stars	0
I love you church and state.. i really do. But the boy and i went to eat for date night there last saturday and what an unfortunate choice it was. We ordered a healthy round of food, including the escargot. big mistake. i popped one in my mouth and it immediately tasted a little funky and slightly foul. Which leads me to believe that it caused me my gastrointestinal pains the next day. gross. never again. Other than that, the server and the desserts were divine. So thank you and no thank you.	0
I've eaten here a number of times. Food is average but nonetheless typical for a large microbrewery. The beer range and quality is good. The outdoor patio is very pleasant on a warm summer day. 	1
Kariem and Millie are extremely kind, gracious, and passionate hosts at this authentic-as-it-gets Tunisian /Mediterranean eatery. Incredibly fresh hommous, BabaGanoush, home made Tunisian crouton bread, and the star of the show: world-class falafel made fresh and with a traditional recipe. Cosy interiors and warm service on top of the simple, homey cuisine make this place worth the trip over to Williamsburg for if you&#39;re from another part of town, and a regular haunt for anyone living in the neighborhood.	1
Very nice staff. Very blah food. I had the chilli and asked for extra sour cream, which I got. It was OK, but this is probably the spot at 2am and not really at any other time.	0
Oh The Wood, you bum me out. I WANT to like you SO BAD. Here's what's good:the food...sometimeshappy hourthe location, location, locationtasty wine and beer selectionsBad:the food...sometimes the super slow servicePlease, I beg you, try harder, take pride. You have SO much potential - great location, a yummy sounding menu, cool indoor/outdoor space, a firepit for goodness sake. Everything is lined up for awesomeness - help us like you. Good luck!	0
Really great sandwiches (actually it's all good). Been going there for over 20 years, and it's still good. Man, I could go for the Fairfax right now!	1
My boyfriend and I were just in L.A. on vacation for our anniversary. Our original plan was to go to Mexi Cali Tacos &amp; Co. but they were closed. And we stumbled upon this hidden gem instead. The service was good. The place is small with limited seating. They offer a nice, delicious salsa bar and have restrooms on the side. Now the best part: the TACOS! my boyfriend had their fish tacos, which they advertise as &#34;LA&#39;s best fish tacos&#34; and we agreed. They were amazing! I had the al pastor tacos and damn, so good. I can&#39;t wait to go back to Hollywood just to stop here again. If you get the chance, definitely check this place out!!	1
small combo is good for three people	1
Primo location in Fairfax village and once home of many a movie star like Jack Benny, Lizabeth Taylor, and Marilyn. Decent layout of booths and tables in two separate rooms but seriously requires a Hollywood facelift. Wish the waitresses smiled more. I pray you don't get stuck with the testy matzo ball with legs- Fran. About the corned beef & pastrami here- it's costly and won't curl your toes. Avoid the stoned homeless bums and cockroaches outside! For a supremely better meal try Izzys and Juniors on the Westside. Go Now! Open 24 hours except on Yom Kippur & Rosh Hashanah. beverly and fairfax, north of the Grove.The Kibbitz Room bar, connected to the diner, features local rock n roll talent during the week and end. Excruciatingly small venue where the audience is practically standing on the stage leaning on the guitarist.	0
This place is really cute. They have a great wine list and a lot of happy hour specials. I had the gluten free crust and it was really good. Now all they need is vegan cheese...and no I am not vegan!!Parking wasn't a problem either, can't wait to go back!!	1
Meh. Came back but sat at the bar this time. Ordered drinks which was poured instantly because well... we were sitting at the bar. Ordered a single appetizer (fries with curry sauce) and found the wait to be quite long despite being in the middle of the afternoon and not busy at all. Service from the kitchen was below average. The only thing they have going for them is guinness on tap. I stand by my original 2 stars.	0
Family Donut makes French Crullers which gives them an A in my book. Sure there's no seating or atmosphere and the place often looks deserted but the donuts are great and fresh and did I mention the crullers?	1
Best short rib and Kimchi fried rice. They have a great selection of banchan too. For under $20 they surely treat you like a king!	1
I&#39;ve been coming to the Pantry for breakfast since I was a youngin! This place is among the fondest memories that I have of LA grouped with Disneyland, Universal Studios, Hollywood, the beaches, the hikes, and good old USC. When I went to undergrad at USC, I became a regular on the weekends... either walking or biking to grab a bite. Throughout all of these years, the food has been consistently delicious despite it being always crowded. Dont worry...that line is always ridiculous but it moves fast. Best part is that it&#39;s cheap and it never closes. Definitely a piece of LA history that is a must. Make it apart of your LA experience.	1
Charming restaurant with a lovely outside space. Flavors were all on point! Tried the sunchockes, lamb belly and slow cooked lamb, all really yummy!! Checkitout	1
Oh yea, Paseo rocks.	1
Well I know what I&#39;ll be craving from now on. The Roost served up some crazy good chicken and sides to my friends and I. They got the spicy chicken sandwich, I got the quarter order of herb seasoned chicken. Both were fresh, bursting with flavor, and a good serving size. The sides were great as well. The biscuit is light and fluffy, the peach cobbler was sweet and crispy, and the Mac and cheese was too notch.<br><br>The prices aren&#39;t bad, and the service is a little slow but still easy. Will for sure be back.	1
Came here for the smores desert after a friend's recommendation... When we got there we were told the smores desert was taken off the menu because it was too hard for the kitchen to make. Really? Too hard for the kitchen to make? Don't give that excuse...thats just lazy.	0
Lemonade was watered down and had a taste that reminded me of store bought lemonade that is past its' prime. Steak sandwich and garlic fries were bland. Immensely disappointed!	0
So here we go, as a Food critic person I notice everything. Venue is great and wonderful, the venue looks very clean and maintained. The worker that greets customers and seats people in is very nice but at the same time stated to us that we were not able to sit on the tables because of reservations Two ladies came in and stated to him that they wouldn't like to seat in the stools but rather have a table and the worker walked them in and have them seated in a table. I felt really bad because I didn't get that option but it's okay I'm fine with seating at a stool. We ordered our food and I really can say the food is good. The only thing I would say is the customer service is not so good. We ordered limes and soy sauce and the lady did not show up with our items at all. I understand that a restaurant can be busy but the customer service part of a restaurant is important because lucky to us this place is busy. I will definitely be writing an article about this restaurant on our next newspaper episode.	0
Great service, atmosphere, and amazing sushi. Also, the fried chicken was phenominal.	1
My favorite brunch place in Madison. It is really really delicious food. Everything I order is always hot, and cooked deliciously. I usually get the scramble or a smoothie but seriously, everything here is so good.	0
portions on the smaller side but interesting and tasty! mellow. i would def go back.	1
Great food, good atmosphere, good beer. Would definitely stop by again. P.S. there&#39;s a back patio!	1
Marjorie relocated to Cap Hill and reopened recently but when I stopped by the place felt like it had been there forever. Like a neighborhood bistro where everyone's a regular and if that's not yet the case then the Owner is sure to stop by and welcome you like family.	1
The lomo saltado with french fries was amazing! Simple does not always mean easy. Sure, it&#39;s a beef stew with tomatoes and onions but there was a depth of flavor that only comes with a long stewing time and experience. The desserts were just as good as the main menu, the atmosphere was pleasant as were the waiters. What a gem!	1
We had 7 pm reservations and we weren&#39;t seated until 730! The food was very under seasoned.....the wait staff was non existing, but the busy boys were in pint with drink refills. Good thing I always carry tapatio in my purse!!	0

Amazing food attentive service and comfortable atmosphere; the squash gorgonzola pizza is incredible. A great way to end the day! Highly recommend!	1
I shoulda gotten the BBQ. Why, oh, why do I go to places like these and order the thing that is my go-to for Thai, but clearly not the house specialty? The Panang Curry sauce was fine, but the beef that was inside it was very tough (and just a note I like chicken in my Panang). I couldn&#39;t get through it. White rice is extra--whaaat? Just used to that being standard with the meal. Obviously, this is a place where you order the special and don&#39;t diverge from that plan. As it is, I&#39;m not much of a meat on a stick-type person, so I dunno if I&#39;ll be back. If someone else wants to go, I guess I will.	0
I came on a Tuesday with a group of four with a reservation and it was not crowded at all. We didn't even need a reservation , which is nice to know. You have a beautiful view from no matter where you sit and would recommend you sit outside as their heat lamps are VERY warm - I even had to take off my jacket! :) love that-you can never be warm enough outside. If you do have a table when you eat dinner, I would recommend you stay there to have drinks instead of go upstairs. We made a big mistake as there was no room to sit upstairs . The only issue I had was that there was not much variety with the dinner menu and I wish there were more options. This is definitely a perfect date night location though. Very romantic.	1
Really great burgers. Lots of nice menu selections with a Wisconsin theme and locally sourced ingredients. Well thought out beer list, again with a WI focus. Good wines too. We'll be back!	0
Felt like wings and dropped by for a take out. Place was PACKED and loudloud.<br>The wings tasted like spicy pieces of fried cardboard. Is this what everyone raves about?<br>Shame on you	0
Well. Well....well. Daikokuya. Me and Daikokuya, we&#39;ve always enjoyed each other&#39;s company. I&#39;ve been coming here to eat ramen for 9 years, and throughout that whole time Daikokuya has been at the top of my list for ramen. Deep, savory rich broth; chewy noodles and melt-in-your-mouth pork. So good. Heaven. <br><br>I haven&#39;t been by as often as I used to, but this last time marked a huge change. We swung by Monday at 11 am sharp to get a booth. My friend dropped me off out front while he parked. I went in, waited to be sat. There was no one ahead of me, everyone else had been sat, there was a booth and most of the counter open. I waited. I wrote my name down on the list, just in case. I waited some more. Waitresses came and went to the tables, taking orders and bringing food. My friend eventually showed up, having parked and walked over, and we waited some more. Maybe 12 minutes total of just standing there. They&#39;re not supposed to sit you unless you&#39;re whole party is there, but they didn&#39;t know that since they never approached me. Eventually someone wandered over and let us sit at the last booth. Not a good sign, but Daikokuya has spotty service sometimes, and I don&#39;t come for the service anyway. I come for the food. <br><br>We ordered and said food came promptly. I got the fried rice/ramen combo, friend got the pork bowl/ramen. Salad and fried rice was tasty and just as good as it always has been, but my friend&#39;s pork was half-burnt. Still tasty, but half of it was pretty crispy black. <br><br>Then our ramen came out. This is the source of my sadness. You can read the other reviews that attest to the deliciousness of Daikokuya&#39;s broth. What we got served wasn&#39;t it. The broth was thinner, tasteless. It tasted like salt water with some garlic thrown in. No depth, no hidden richness. Just murky salt liquid. The noodles tasted stale and old. They felt mealy and leaden, and there was no chew when you bit into them. They lay in the soup like dead worms. The bean sprouts were same as always, but I found maybe two pieces of bamboo total in the bowl. Sad. The pork was also reliably good, but we both only got two pieces per bowl. I&#39;m pretty sure the serving size used to be bigger. I&#39;ve always found the seasoned egg to be hit-and-miss too, and today it was a miss. Just the barest hint of taste, and the inside was dry, dry, dry. Sad. Also, the waitress completely forgot spoons, and it took a couple tries to get them.<br><br>It&#39;s usually a struggle to polish off a whole bowl of the ramen, and though I normally don&#39;t make it to the end, I put up a valiant fight, polishing off all the noodles and hunting around for those last bits of pork and bamboo that hide out at the bottom of the bowl, drinking as much broth as I can handle. We all waddle out the door and groan about how full our bellies are. This visit, my friend and I both ate half-heartedly till we were full, pushed the bowls away, and got the check. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back until someone tells me Daikokuya is back as well. Frankly, now that Ramen Jinya has added their tonkotsu black broth to the menu full-time, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll even miss you, Daikokuya. I wish that made me sadder.	0
I am extremely dissatisfied with my experience. <br><br>I drove 2.5 hours to have brunch here with 7 other friends that were joining from out of town. We made a reservation a few days before on Open Table, and my friend called to make sure we would not be charged a fee for having a table of 8. He even called again a few days before to confirm the reservation. Everything was set to go. <br><br>We called the restaurant twice today to mention we would be 15 minutes late, as traffic was heavy, and were surprised that both times, no one picked up. <br><br>We all individually took a car service to the restaurant so we could have bottomless mimosas. We met at the restaurant just to find out they were closed this weekend. <br><br>We never received a call telling us of this inconvenience, and our very limited time together was wasted figuring out another restaurant that was available for a table of 8 within the time period we were together. <br><br>Quite an embarrassment when you have a large group together, confidently confirm plans are two separate times, and are then having to explain yourself when everyone came from out of town for a short reunion. <br><br>Seeing that my time was not respected and they were unorganized, I will be sure to look for other places for bottomless mimosas and delicious food next time I get a large group together!	0
A great place for Japanese food that's relatively affordable in the middle of Little Tokyo.We were seated promptly on a Sunday evening. The staff is polite and courteous, the fish was fresh (it easily melted in my mouth), and the environment is cool, right in Little Tokyo. It's not the best Japanese food, not the best sushi, and not the best environment ever, but within it's price bracket it's very delicious.Their special combos are excellent. I tried a little bit of all the items, including hand rolls, sashimi, rolls, breaded pork cutlet, and teriyaki chicken. I particularly enjoyed all the fish and teriyaki chicken (they made it slightly crispy, I'm a sucker for crunchy/crispy food).We stayed and talked for 2-3 hours, never feeling pressured to leave.	1
Such a great vibe! Jazz brunch was amazing. Staff friendly and helpful. Food was to die for. All in all I could not find one negative thing about this place!	1
I really like the view from the rooftop terrace. Service is a little slow but the view makes up for it.It was never too packed when I was there.	1
Uhhhhhbsessed w this place. Had a couple shrimp tacos ($3.50 each) and masa fries ($2). The other tacos (chicken, carne asada, and others were $3 each. Each taco is about the size of my palm. Guac is $0.45 whooooo! Was so good I went back the next day and ordered the same thing. I very well may go back tomorrow and the day after and the day after that as well. <br><br>There&#39;s enough seating for ~15 people along a wall w stools and a long table. You order at the counter and pick up your food on a tray or togo. <br><br>So yummmmmmmmy. This LA girl approves!	1
We were in Havre de Grace for one night and unfamiliar with the town.  We found the Vineyard on Trip Advisor, and the reviews were spot on.  This was a real gem in an unexpected place.	0
I am a very loyal Langer's patron, and I once doubted I would ever visit enemy territory. Well, I found myself craving pastrami on a Sunday. With Langer's closed I decided to make the trip. I arrived during breakfast hours, and decided on scrambled eggs and pastrami. I was hoping to find it far inferior to Langer's. Well, I found them to be almost evenly matched. Canter's pastrami is machine-sliced, while Langer's is hand-sliced, the superior cutting technique. However, the flavor was comparable, I felt. I also appreciated the "old school" decor, along with Langer's, not having been redone in years. Also, bonus points for being open 24/7 and having a bar connected to the main dining room. I may continue to visit on Sundays and evenings, only when Langer's is closed to minimize my guilt.	1
Best restaurant in LA!! I love this place. Great customer service. Great food. Everything in that restaurant is freshly made and homemade there isn&#39;t any premade bought from the store. Desserts are just mouthwatering. Celebrities don&#39;t come here for nothing! The Six is the place to be!	1
You know sometimes I wish Yelp would have a No star option because here is the proud owner of that option!<br>I do not care if this was the original or not the service was just incredibly horrible. Better yet it deserves all the crap your typical irate customer would say.<br>Down and dirty- took forever just to put 2 tables together to accommodate us even though it was empty. Took long to get our order in, the server had no clue that one of the items even existed... Then he waited to serve the whole table to tell me that they had ran out of my item. No apology- nada- ZERO customer service.<br>By then I just wanted out of that place asap! <br>Get your crap right for crying out loud.	0
Great staff. Simple but delicate food. Amazing buildout. This is definitely where the cool people go when they're hungry.	1
I LOVE the location of this place! It's in a small alleyway in Little Tokyo and it's as hipster as it gets. There's lights hanging everywhere and the brick walls and structure sort of gives it a New York neighborhood feel. You can dress up or down for this place and if it's a nice day outside it makes the place that much better! There was however a drunk lady pouring out her problems to this young man who seemed super uncomfortable and looked like he didn't want to be there and she was playing her own music via her phone...take that part out and it's 5 stars for the ambiance!The food was good. My friends and I shared the Chicken Sautee, Curry Dumplings, Far Bar Burger, and a sushi roll! My favorite was the burger. the bread was more light so it burger wasn't too heavy and the sauce they used was really yums! Everything else wasn't bad, but wasn't omg delicious status. In conclusion, this place is definitely about the ambiance!	1
THE BEST THAI FOOD IN L.A. And the best of all their locations. Been going here since I moved to L.A. 37 years ago. EVERYTHING is good. S-1 and S-2 never get old. Ever.<br>2nd favorites, equally, are their panang, sate, chili squid, tom yum, pad thai, chicken noodle, mee krob, wings of angel, lemongrass mint beef/chicken, shrimp fried rice.... Not fancy, not pretentious, affordable, and great for catering parties.	1
Wonderful soups, big salads! Love it for lunch!Fast service, energetic and polite servers, very popular even in off hours.	1
This place is my favorite! It has a great energy and the perfect laid back cafe environment I'm always looking for--perfect for doing some work or meeting a friend for a bite and coffee. The coffee is delicious and made to order by a knowledgable and charming staff--not to mention good looking! Also, once a month they host an awesome comedy show in the studio in the back with great stand up comics. You can always spot the owners walking around and making sure everything is up to snuff. In one word, this place is SPECIAL.	1
My friend and I came in to BIG &amp; little&#39;s on a day when Chicago was being typical Chicago, i.e. cold and windy (and interspersed with rain and hail). Thankfully, the restaurant was cozy and warm. We&#39;d spent a good deal of time earlier that day reading through the menu and having a hard time deciding what tacos to get (since there are about 20 kinds and they all look amazing), but we were prepared by the time we walked through the door.<br><br>The person taking our orders at the counter was neither BIG nor little (he was wearing a shirt with the word &#34;HUGE&#34; embroidered over the pocket, though), but was very friendly and helpful. I decided to go with the Japanese beef short rib, the al pastor, and the shrimp tacos. For the shrimp, you have an option of getting it either fried or grilled - honestly, I can&#39;t even remember which I got, but it was amazing (and after my experience I trust that whichever the other option was would also be great). Also, pro tip: the tacos usually have two layers of tortilla as a shell, but they are pretty overstuffed with filling, so you can take one of the layers of tortilla and move some of the filling into it. Boom, two tacos that you can eat without spilling all over the place, for the price of one.<br><br>We were wondering how the tacos would compare to Big Star - another favorite taco joint of ours - and the verdict was that while the food was on par (i.e. awesome), it was very different. Even if it was the same taco (I&#39;ve tried the al pastor at both locations), the taste was distinct. What this basically means is that you need to go to both. BIG &amp; little&#39;s has the edge over Big Star for me because it&#39;s both closer to me location-wise and less expensive, but both are great. I have no beef with more restaurants on my list of favorite restaurants. More good food = everyone wins. Yes?<br><br>Swing by BIG &amp; little&#39;s for your taco craving (and really, your burger, banh mi, sandwich, and various other foodstuffs craving)! Bring cash, come hungry, and try everything - I know I&#39;ll be back, maybe for the Phil&#39;s fries or the pork belly po&#39; boy next time.	1
Not many sushi bars open on Sunday afternoon so we gave this place a try and we were pleasantly surprised. Everything was really fresh and the standouts were the uni, toro and spicy salmon roll. The servings were generous and yummy.	1
Saturday lunch: great $15 bottomless mimosas and the food was great.Food: amazing (chilaquiles & veggie burger)Seating: booth/window - super comfortableService: fantastic Overall: must visit!! Great owner, staff and the parking was easy (just visit the street around the back or valet).	1
When I think of thai food near Wilshire, this is the spot. There are others like it, but this one is up in my "yay! I'm a fan" spot.Customer service is VERY friendly and every time I've gone has been an enjoyable experience.Food in general is good, but one dish is just...amazing. The S-1 (their popular Thai BBQ Chicken) is a must-try for every first-time Yelpers here. Their other dishes are meh and can definitely be found in the same amount of "wowness" elsewhere.PARKING: Don't bother waiting around the small lot (you'd think midgets -er, little people-- park here) if you can't find a spot. Just head down the street in the residential area to get parking. This way you won't have to spend forever and a day waiting to get out.	1
From the first bite you can tell that they use really high-quality ingredients. The mozzarella is fresh and chewy. The dough has a great bite to it. Even the olive oil is flavorful.But the thing is, this place ONLY does pizza. No appetizers. No salads. No desserts. Just pizza. And only about 6 different kinds. You can only get an egg and meat (only salami) on Saturdays. What's up with that?!?Oh, and one of the first things you read on the menu is "no substitutions, no slices, no extras". No, no, no. I was a little put off at seeing this.The pizza was good, really. But $25 for a 12-in with just cheese, olive oil and 3 basil leaves was not worth it IMO.	0
Yes, it&#39;s cash only.<br><br>Yes, sometimes the wait can be horrendous. (Even an hour!)<br><br>Yes, sometimes the service can be a little yes or no.<br><br>But it&#39;s worth it, smelling those burgers. When you get your fried fries with ketchup, your hickory-sauced hamburger, and cold soda in triangle cup... only to lead it up to BANANA CREAM PIE!!!<br><br>Oh no, now I&#39;m craving it. XD	1
I meet with a group of friends every Monday that insist on going here....why???? I get sick EVERY time I eat the food...everything is loaded with salt. Now I'm just reduced to eating the fries or the blintzes...BUT I still feel like crap afterwards. I gave it two stars only because of the service and because it has parking.	0
It was a Friday night and I was excited to be going out to dinner with my wife and two close friends. <br>One of our friends recommended The Park and made a reservation for us. The restaurant is clean and the menu is pretty interesting *not amazing but definitely worth checking out*. The issue is the customer service and the saddest part of all is that it is not the staff with the poor customer service, it is the owner!<br>One of the people we were dining with ordered the steak and he was very clear with our server that he likes his steak rare. When his steak got to the table he cut it open to find that it was much closer to medium then to rare... He called over our server and politely let her know what the problem was. Our server took the steak and then returned shortly with a new steak and this time the steak was literally cold inside (at this point I was over all the back and forth but I get that it is difficult to cook meat and so I tried not to be annoyed at the restaurant or my friend for that matter!) what happened next was shocking and uncalled for and I would say that even if I was not a restaurant owner myself...<br>Our friend asked to change his order to the fish, assuming this would be a dish that the kitchen could prepare to his liking. Our server looked like she was going to faint and said just one minute please. The owner of the restaurant came over to our table and proceeded to tell my friend that she could not (really it was will not) allow him to change his order. <br>I know how hard it is to please everyone all the time and I also know how difficult it is to get every staff member to be 100% amazing every minute they are working but I do not have any empathy for someone making such a short sided decision as the one this woman made that ruined my Friday night dinner. It sucks to have to comp a meal but it sucks so much more to lose a table of four who would have ordered more wine and even come back if she had just handled this situation with excellent customer service instead of an embarrassingly low level of customer service.	0
Ray&#39;s is my joint! The charcuterie is second to none. Went there for the &#34;wurst&#34; night and ate an incredible sausage all night. Will definitely go back.	1
I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican cuisine and Cantina Laredo just meets all my expectations,  from the service to the food and the atmosphere,  it was just great!! I truly recommend this to anyone looking for a great place to just relax and enjoy some Mexican food.	1
My daughter told me about this place a few months ago. 	1
I&#39;ve been here a few times - the first time, they were closed...at 8:30pm! What restaurant closed around dinner time?! This!<br><br>So, we went here at lunch time hoping they&#39;d be open. The restaurant is rather small with a bar-stool area and maybe 7 tables. They have fried chicken fingers and grilled chicken. They have sides such as rice, veggies, fries, seasoned fries, dinner roll, etc.<br><br>Mochiko Chicken Bowl:<br>Grilled chicken and rice. I asked for veggies and sauce on the side. The chicken itself was flavorful enough and I didn&#39;t really need the sauce. The sauce was good though. It was like a Hawaiian version of Cane&#39;s sauce. The veggies were a good mix: carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn, snap peas and red bell pepper. 4/5<br><br>Srirachi Chicken Bowl:<br>Grilled chicken and rice. Veggies added. The sauce was mildly spicy and tasty. 4/5<br><br>Lychee Lemonade:<br>If you like lychee, you&#39;d love this drink. I don&#39;t so, I don&#39;t really have an unbiased opinion about this drink.<br><br>The fried Mochiko chicken fingers look good and huge. Seasoned fries also sound good since I have a weakness for fries. I&#39;ll give them a try next time.	1
I had a savory chicken crepe, and my wife had a sweet almond, chocolate, and pears. <br>The chicken was pretty dry and the mushrooms were from a can. Pretty disappointing. My wife&#39;s: her chocolate was good; her almonds, almost nonexistent, tiny slivers, and her pears hard and unripe.<br>Overall: disappointing. Service was very nice, with a slight caveat: being asked whether I want him to bring me back change wasn&#39;t very nice of him. I left a nice tip anyways. The wait staff should never be punished for the chef&#39;s poor ingredients.	0
I'm not one to review a place but after being sick all night I had to. I took a client out to lunch this week at The Brixton. I generally enjoy this place for cocktails and beers and thought lunch would be a good idea. I ordered a chicken salad. It was fried chicken and sounded pretty good so I went for it. Halfway though it I thought it tasted a little funny so I stopped eating it and wrote it off as just a bad dish. I'm not one to make a big deal and send things back. Later that evening I began throwing up and all the fun stuff associated with food poisoning. It was a long and torturous night reminiscent of my travels in Indonesia. I had meetings all day the next day and had to cancel everything. I was laid up for the entire day and then some. Normally I wouldn't write on Yelp about this. Instead Its my standard to call a Business and tell them whats up. I called during their business hours and left a message. Expecting at least a call back. Nothing. So naturally I thought I would spread the word here. They may be a nice place to visit but I wont be going back nor will my friends. If a business cares about their service then this should be top of the list before any more people get sick. Its obviously not. I'm still not out of the woods yet and I can imagine I'm not the only one. If you want to have a good night and enjoy some great food this is San Francisco, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.	0
Mickies Dairy Bar is a Madison must-do. Generations of UW-Students, alumni, football fans, locals, athletes and their families all frequent Mickies.	1
2 for friendly service. reasonably clean but the soup was so boring and bland.	0
Man, let me tell ya. My sister lived in Argentina for a year and a half and she is obsessed with it. So, when we found this place she was very excited to go and show me some of the food she fell in love with while there. When I first went in I was terrified cuz, lets be honest, its kind of a grungy dark place. But we sat down and got some bread with the chimichurri sauce and I was hooked. I cant tell you how good that stuff is. If I didnt think that I would get a horrible case of the runs I would pour it on my ice cream and stir it into my drinks.<br>We got some milanesas and empanadas and they were AMAZING! The empanadas were so delicious that I often find my mind drifting to the wonderful moments where I placed the fine morsels of food on my tongue and remembering how my tongue had never felt more loved than at that moment. <br>I recommend this place to everyone. The owner is amazingly nice and the food is fantastic.	1
My fourth visit to the newly redecorated location.  A comfortable ambience.  The food is great...they make their pasta from scratch which is good for lots of points.  They know how to cook calamari properly.  Friendly and knowledgeable wait-staff.  This visit was with four friends for a birthday get together.  They loved it .  My new go to place for lunch.	0
I strolled in here because we were close by. First off, there was a Looooooooong line. We figured the food was good. We were really hungry so we stayed in line. It took forever to get to the front of the line. <br><br>It also states that people should not sit until they have paid. Obviously, people do not follow this rule and the business does not enforce it. <br><br>The topping to the cake was when I finally got to the front of the line and the cashier ignored me. Did not even bother to acknowledge me. A nice &#34;I will be with you in a moment&#34; would have been appreciated. Finally after refunding someone&#39;s money and ignoring me she finally took my order. As I gave her my CREDIT CARD she points to this TINY sign that read &#34;CASH ONLY&#34;. I got sooooooooo pissed because it did not have this sign at the entrance.<br><br>Waste of my time! If you don&#39;t mind poor customer service, long lines, and people to tell you &#34;only cash&#34; once you&#39;ve waited for a million years, then this is the place for you! Otherwise, go somewhere else. I highly encourage people to go elsewhere!	0
Was in Madison for a wedding and was staying at the Hyatt downtown which was across from this restaurant. Reviews were good so decided to try out the lunch buffet and I was not disappointed. They had a bigger than normal selection of items and most importantly it was all fresh. A lot of times indian buffets have food that feels like it is a day or two old but this place each and every item was fresh. The goat curry was da bomb, the meat was tender and the curry had the perfect zing to it. The tandoori chicken was extremely good and fresh and so was the chicken tawa tikka. They even had one indo-chinese item, i.e. chicken manchurian which most indian restaurants screw up really badly but this one was by far one of the best I've had (probably second only to the restaurants on Oak Tree in Edison, NJ).	0
Amazing. Delicious. Fresh!	1
Expensive for a burger and fries (and sometimes pie, too), but ohh so worth it.<br><br>I really enjoy the hickory sauce they put on the hickory burger--so much so that I order a side of it for dipping my fries.<br><br>Don&#39;t come here and expect to get a friendly service. Ever see the Seinfeld episode with the Soup Nazi? The guys behind the counter are his brothers.	1
Tried A LOT of different stuff - Oysters, Shishito Peppers, Salad, and Cheeseburger...they were all great. I prefer their Burger over Umami any day. Great design and surprisingly friendly staff - not what you might expect for a stereotypical hipster spot. I will definitely be coming back.	1
Went with a good friend. We both enjoyed this place. Presentation, flavor and portions sizes were all great. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Had the fried appetizer plate. Veggies, shrimp, a piece of lemon (odd) but so good. The mac n cheese was yummy. I had the skirt steak and potato salad. No knife needed to cut the meat. Super juicy and tender. Will definitely be back. :)	1
I absolutely loved Perch! It has a beautiful view overlooking downtown LA. I went for brunch and the food was delicious and reasonable in price. My plate was about $14 not bad at all. However the drinks are definitely a bit more pricey. I believe I paid about $15 for a cocktail drink. So if you want to avoid paying a high bill I would stay away from the cocktail drinks. <br><br>Last but not least make sure you make a reservation. I went this past Sunday and it took about 20min to get seated so I can only imagine how long people without reservations have to wait. <br><br>Tip: The restaurant is located on the rooftop so look for the name on the building or a security guy outside and you have found it. He will then guide you to the elevator so you can be on your way! (It&#39;s on the 18th or 17th floor I think ) - not sure	1
Heard so much about this new restaurant, so we gave it a try during our thanksgiving visit in LA. Glad that we did it! The food is super YUMMY and Authentic! Very impressed with their special menu featuring unique and rare dishes hardly seen in any other Thai places. Totally love it and will be back when we hit LA again. <br><br>Food we ordered: <br>- papaya salad: my favorite dish! Must try and Very tasty <br>- kua Kling pork: spicy minced pork. my mother in law favorite <br>- Zeed noodles: yumm! <br>- fried chicken: Must try. <br>- crab curry: they put real crab in. Hands required <br>- Thai tea pudding :) <br><br>Venue: thumbs up for easy parking. Though a bit small place but the food is totally worth it. <br><br>GREAT and Friendly Services!	1
Freds is my favorite spot to grab some food. I'm not sure if it's either because it's located in a cool area, it's open 24 hours orrrrr because the grilled cheeses are amaze-balls! There have been many small changes made in the diner over the years, like the menus and the uniform shirts. As far as the menu change goes, i know that you have to ask for a side of fries for your food as opposed to before the fries came with your order. The old uniform shirts were hilarious with witty and interesting expressions written on the back, but i guess they changed it because people got offended.... but, c'mon it's not Fred 62 without those cool shirts!I normally order the club or the grilled cheese and both are to die for! i'm a simple gal and this place is the best to satisfy my simple taste. The banana milkshake is a must try! soooooo yummy!	1
I love this place! I have been cheating on the LA Brewing Co. with you guys for a while now, and you guys have me hooked! I am absolutely adored with the ambiance and design of the place, hidden in between alleys in Little Tokyo. I was first taken here on a date, and was reallly sketched out when he suggested we walk down a dark alley -_-. but then the alley lit up into this amazingly beautiful outdoor patio with lights strung all over the place. Besides the amazing ambiance, they have a great drink selection! I have been searching everywhere for authentic Japanese alcohol and I finally found a place that can provide that. <br><br>Also, the bartenders are very decent looking. I suggest everyone go here, every weekend!	1
So good! I still dream about their burgers and apple pie.I can't wait to go back!!!	1
So so food with poor service	0
Maybe the perfect weather for a Friday night dinner outdoors influenced my rating, but we had a great experience this weekend. I wasn't expecting a lot for a chain.Three of us dined at Francesca's for the first time. With a great view of the Capitol from the outside tables, it made for a great setting.	0
Fried food, while delicious, is not my go-to choice. So when we were heading here I was questioning the decision. Really? We&#39;re going to yet another low quality place that deep fries the cheapest meat they could find and serves it with rice for $10?<br><br>Wrong. I did not know this place was legit. Prices are a couple dollars up, but what you get is much, much better than your run-of-the-mill fried meat spot.<br><br>First of all, there is a little container of sesame seeds that you can crush up and mix with katsu sauce to make a very savory and rich dipping sauce for your katsu. It is delicious. Get it ready, because you&#39;re going to have some of the best katsu you&#39;ve ever had.<br><br>Our dish of pork was served with a high pile of shredded cabbage (?), some rice, and a dressing for the cabbage. The pork itself was breaded and cooked absolutely perfectly. Seriously. The pork was extremely tender and juicy. The crunch on the outside was perfect because it wasn&#39;t too hard, or too greasy. Just right. I couldn&#39;t believe I was actually enjoying it.<br><br>I couldn&#39;t give a bigger endorsement than that. Give them a try.	1
Terrific happy hour, decent beer selection, a huge whiskey list and wings that'll knock your socks off!This place seems a bit hidden in the tiny alley-way entrance, but it is actually attached to the old Chop Suey place next door, and you can get in through there too.But nothing beats the experience of crowding into a narrow alley that opens up onto the luminous and magical area that is Far Bar.	1
My wife and I were in the mood for pizza today and based upon all of the wonderful reviews on Yelp that we had read about Pizza Johny&#39;s we decided to give this place a try. I was surprised when I arrived to find that I had met Johny last year when he was a partner and chef at another Italian restaurant in town. I had enjoyed his food in the past and knew right away that we were going to have a great meal. We ordered a veggie pizza with tomatoes, garlic, black olives, and roasted peppers, plus some garlic rolls. The pizza was honestly the best I had in many years. The dough was amazing and the toppings were very fresh and plentiful. The garlic rolls were baked to perfection and were as tasty as can be. Johny is a very gracious host and made sure that we were well taken care of. He even brought us a little bowl with some extra roasted garlic cloves to add to our pizza. As a special treat Johny remembered how much I had liked rainbow bars in the past and presented my wife and I each with one for dessert. Thank you Johny for the great meal and we look forward to coming back in the near future to try some of the other items on your menu.	1
My girlfriend and I went there for her birthday dinner. I was gonna get the steak but she told me the grouper was excellent. I'm not a big seafood person but I was blown away. The fish was lightly battered with a huge crunch and the fish was soft and tasted great. The shrimp and rice were really good and I don't care for shrimp. I would recommend this to anyone looking to treat someone to a nice meal or just want to get some great seafood.	0
To be fair, the food here worth 4 stars.<br><br>However, I don&#39;t think the service here(if there is any) even worth tipping.<br>Impatient waitress.<br>Have to get yourself drinking water using plastic cup in the middle of the room.<br>Cash only and no bills larger than 20$...<br><br>Seriously? <br>I have got better service in a sandwich stand, which does not require tips at all!	0
Recently, I needed a place in the neighborhood to have brunch with 18 other people, and Bluephies was the choice. We made a reservation weeks in advance. The service and accommodations were beyond fantastic. Our meals came out at about the same time; beverages were refilled in a timely manner. We were able to stay as long as we wanted and the 18 of us had a great time. HOWEVER, the food was Perkins-grade greasy average-ish. Someone was repulsed enough to send their meal back and just stick with the coffee. Still underwhelmed with the food and cannot justify adding any stars.	0
There's not much that's memorable about this place aside from the long line you're going to be waiting in to order and the community seating that will likely leave you a little frustrated. Why will it frustrate you? Because the local yokels will resist sharing the space around them. Don't rely on anyone being decent. You're going to have to elbow your way in. The food, well that was just... meh.Maybe two visits isn't a large enough sample to draw such conclusions from, but that's how I feel after my two times here.	0
My girlfriend and I went here for the first time for our anniversary, and we had a great experience! The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. If anything, they were a little too over zealous in how frequently they checked on us haha<br><br>The food was incredible, and I would come back again only to order the calamari steak and the braised short rib again! Both were unbelievable. <br><br>The place is newer, and they are very clearly eager to please. At times it was too much, but when is wanting to be great restaurant a bad thing?<br><br>It&#39;s a great addition to the area, and I hope to god it is successful as it seems to be the only Moroccan in the area that serves such high quality. I would argue better than a ton of restaurants on the strip, and much more affordable too!<br><br>The decor was also beautiful and we enjoyed seeing the belly dancer while we ate!<br><br>Thank you William and the rest of the team for giving us a wonderful anniversary dinner!	1
Don&#39;t waste your money. The food I got was fine, nothing outstanding though, and definitely overpriced. I spent $8 for 10 small beet cubes. I&#39;m very surprised they charge so much for so little! If it tasted amazing, it might be worth it, but honestly, it was just standard bar food. See photo of beets.	0
Open on New Years Day 2010, they will soon be opened 24hrs. Excellent Chipotle Chicken Wraps and Panini are both savory and sweet and enough to be eaten at once or split into two meals for lunch and dinner.	1
After having to endure a lot of really bad burgers in L.A. it was great too find Whiz. Located at a anonymous corner, this small place offers tasty and original dishes. No pommes was included however and there wasn't much space to stay around and eat there.	1
I guess if I had ordered the sushi maybe the experience would be different. Came in on a Thursday evening on a recommendation from my hotel and the place wasn\u2019t really busy. Asked for a table but the wait staff said they had reservations coming in and would I mind sitting at the sushi bar. Not great but a basketball game was on so I could manage. I was not in the mood for sushi so I ordered some yakitori and yakisobi. And I waited and I waited. 	0
Very elegant space. Delicious raw/vegan. Had the cheezy lime popcorn. Sweet + savory. The Chinoise salad (I still have no idea how to pronounce this) was crunchy and delicious. Finished the night off with the choconut x-tasy which reminded me of a Hail Merry tart or macaroon. <br><br>Excellent list of organic booze and organic and biodynamic wines. <br><br>Great spot to go before a show at the Ahmanson.	1
This place reminds me of large porions of slop on a plate. I got a salad and yes it was huge. the quality was gross and they chicken tasted frozen. The food here years ago was much better. Also I went in a few times and the bread on my sandwich was stale. PASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS	0
The food was okay. Nothing very special. There was not much space to sit. Two tables in side and two out side. My boyfriend and i had no space to sit and it was too chilly to be outside, so we decided to eat in the car...	0
Gertrude's on Tuesdays is THE place to be as many of the entrees are $02.00. Crab cakes are outstanding  &amp; fried chicken is the best in town. The cream of crab soup is filled with back fin crab and very rich. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Sitting outside in spring, summer and fall can't be beat, over- looking the Baltimore Museum of Art's Sculpture Garden. The owner, John Schields, is a serious and knowledgeable foodie and that is reflected in his menu.	0
Pretty on par with your average Indian buffet. Except the portions are really small and the hostess was incredibly rude.	0
I had been to G and the Goat and found the food to be so oversalted that it was nearly inedible. Sadly, my experience there was twinned at the Little Goat. The decor of the restaurant is adorable, and the boisterous diner vibe is nicely conducive to meeting up with your pals. So I was hopeful. I ordered the root vegetables and boo boo baise. The vegetables were cold and seasonless, and the boo baise while a nicely generous portion was so oversalted that I ate trepidatiously. My friend ordered the tempura mashed potatoes which were just ok though I admired the weirdness of trying to fry a mashed potato. Another friend ordered the Japanese pork item--and was surprised to find it unattractively sandwiched within white bread. I tried it and the pork was chewy and...salty. At some point I began to feel ill...I don&#39;t know if it was the salt, the quality of the mussels (which on first gulp tasted &#34;off&#34; to me and I only ate one), but later in the night I was ill. I actually had to leave early because the smell of salt and grease and bad acoustics were making me feel worse. I have to say, I think Chef Izard&#39;s personality from watching her seems very warm and full of great energy, but I have never felt that translated into her food. I think the biggest perpetrator is the SALT but also the presentation of the food...just slopped onto the plate with no real artform. I later explained to another friend why the experiences at these restaurants turned me off, and he offered Avec as a great example of a small plates restaurant that uses interesting meats and combinations but it&#39;s always artful, beautifully prepared and presented and you feel really connected to what you&#39;re eating. I can&#39;t connect to food when it is so doused in salt.	0
The late night food selection in LA is for the most part pretty pathetic. I can&#39;t even remember how many times I found myself at a Denny&#39;s or Norm&#39;s at 3am wondering why I was eating a dish I would never think to order sober while sitting in a depressingly sterile space. <br><br>I like Canter&#39;s because it obviously caters to a drunk crowd looking for a nosh post-bar but it still has a lot of character and yummy selections. After perusing the ginormous menu for a long time, I settled on the potato pancakes last night. You can choose a side of apple sauce or sour cream but of course I went with both and was not disappointed. I liked the flavor but I didn&#39;t think it seemed super fresh and piping hot. Those who got Canter&#39;s famous pastrami sandwiches seemed very pleased with their selections, especially the warm chips, although we were told that they&#39;re not homemade as we thought. <br><br>The late night service was very friendly and efficient, though it did take a little while for our stuff to come out. The guy at the cash register up front was very chatty and cool as well, and even complimented my dining date Katie B on her lovely pink onesie pajamas. <br><br>It&#39;s a comfy and cool place to go when you&#39;re starving and don&#39;t want the night to end yet!	1
I have always appreciated the service here. And I like the vegetarian options too.	1
First time eating here and I was very pleased. Turkey salad on challah bread is very good. Matzo ball soup is hot and delicious, though I would like to see more veggies in the soup and the option of a smaller portion. Tomato pickles are delectable too.	1
I brought my brother and sister in law here from out of town because of the rave reviews for how good the chicken is. He ordered the grilled garlic soy ones and she got some of the crispy variety. The verdict: they were "alright". The potato wedges were decent for potato wedges. I mean you can basically get the same quality at KFC or some fast food joint. The exceptionally bad thing was the service. It was downright the worst dining experience I've had since maybe high school denny's late night. We place our order. It seriously took like 45 minutes for them to bring it out... well, part of it out. After asking 3 times for sauce for the wrap we had to get up and go to the front and get it ourselves. they never brought the rice balls, the broccoli salad or one of the drinks. Mind you, this is maybe one step above a fast food joint. There were no other parties dining in and at least 9 people working behind the counter. The buzzer on our table was broken. They never brought the check. They didn't apologize. We finally got up and went to the front and asked for the check THEY CHARGED US for all of the items they didn't bring! Then they took forever to take it off the bill and as we were leaving one of the employees leaves for a smoke break and is blocking our exit. My worst experience dining in LA ever!	0
Had a good...nice place...would go again. The only thing I would criticize is the crab cake was delicious but had a spring summer kinda flavor to it	0
The only reason to come here is for the view. The food is not worth the price. It actually wouldn&#39;t be worth the price if they dropped it by 10%. I would guess the happy hour specials would make the price for drinks more reasonable. The only way I am going back is if I just plan on having drinks.	0
Love the murg bahar!	1
Dear Greeks,<br>Your food is far from the Best ever, Turkish food trumps Greek, hands down. Your wine is borderline wretched, and don&#39;t insult me by telling me you don&#39;t carry Baklava, when a. I was addressing my bf with what texture I wanted for dessert b. Don&#39;t tell me what to order, when I know more about your cuisine and my bf knows more about wine pairings and yes that includes your wine and lastly, c. your desserts are not so delectable that you must pressure me to order one every 2 min after my entree. <br><br>Ya, skip this place, go Turkish! ;)	0
I&#39;ve been meaning to do this for a few months. We have ordered about 4 or 5 times and every time it came quickly and the food is amazing! ( delivery guy is very sweet) <br>We always order cheeseburgers and either regular fries or onion rings- all AMAZING and the fries are crispy when they arrive. <br>Don&#39;t hesitate, order right now... We are! <br>PS. Their brownies are worth the splurge :0)	1
The food is very good.  Gourmet quality.  Portions modest, which I think is good.  Service was very good:  attentive, without being overbearing,m and pleasant.  My only negative is that it is exceptionally expensive.  If it is four stars for the food and service, it is five stars for price.	1
I am a big acai bowl fan, and this is by far the best acai bowl you can get in southern California. In Southern California alone, I&#39;ve tried Banzai, Earthbar, Liquid Juice Bar, Birdie Bowls, etc. They don&#39;t really come close to preserving the delicate flavor of the acai berries.<br><br>I scooped a generous spoonful from the bowl, took a bite, and fell in love with the fact that I could taste the individual ingredients that were put into the mix. The bowl was good to the end, unlike bowls I&#39;ve had at places that use apple juice to sweeten the bowls (Banzai). Their bowls tends to taste more and more like apple juice as I get to the bottom. The bowl I got was lightly sweetened with agave. I asked them to put in less agave than the amount they usually put in, and the staff was very accommodating and friendly.<br><br>Also, If you have had an acai bowl, you will agree that fresh toppings really add to the whole experience. I took a peek inside the truck, and I saw them peeling and chopping the fruits themselves, so I knew the toppings were fresh. Overall, I am very excited that this truck&#39;s gonna be coming around my work. Come more often to West LA, please!	1
I didn't get to eat there but the drinks, decor and view of downtown was great! I love it! going up two elevators was a little scary for all of you scared of that sorta thing..... It's super frenchy and beautiful establishment. Doesn't open until 4 or 5pm I believe. Only thing is drinks and descriptions all have fancy names.... They had another name for bitters.... Kinda felt dumb asking what all the different words meant.... Regardless, the drinks all tasted great! Would def go back and try out the food!	1
Best meal I've had in a really long time. I'm visiting from new york and the food was better than most places in new york. My boyfriend is from key west and is very critical about key lime pie and he thought dom's key lime pie was really good. The hanger steak and ricotta gnocchi was excellent. Service was ok. Atmosphere was good.	1
really old furniture and not in a charming way but in an unstable way. the bubble tea with raspberry i had was bad. i politely asked them to change it to something else and i think it was the manager who told me i'm sorry we don't do that when the customer doesn't like it. it has to be a defective product......i just gave her the drink and walked away. 	0
The food is pretty good! Great atmosphere and a great location but it was disappointing because their staff forgot everything even when we reminded them twice.. Staff are friendly but by the end of our night we still didn&#39;t get what we asked for.	0
Fairness b. stay home and watch the voice please. The world will be better. In fact, just stay home always.	1
Great watering hole for east side yuppies that serves up wonderful frozen margaritas. Try the swordfish tacos or the chicken mole. Reasonably price but book as a recervation for Thurs through Saturday nights as it can become crowded.	1
It pains my heart to write this update but my husband & I ate there last week and the food was WACK. Like I can't even talk about how awful each dish was (we ordered 2 apps and 2 entrees) Plus it took over 20 mins to get us our first drink. I asked the waitress nicely what was going on... She didn't really have a good answer. There are so many places to go in this area just keep it moving.	0
Been here twice, once during their busy nights, and another after a workday.The place is nice, easily missed, but that adds to the exclusivity of knowing about it.Pretentious LA, I love it already.Decent food, wasabi ranch fries are bomb. Full bar, good music (electro-house mixes), and a projector of random movies play against the brick walls. The servers are attentive and Far Bar is one of those places you'd expect people to bar hop through. Space gets cramped by the bar easily so bear with it.	1
Popped in for a quick bite. Decent neighorhood hangout. Food is basic french fare but nothing particularly stands out.. Coquet Monsier was fine but felt it needed a better cheese and was under-seasoned. Would try again but only if I'm in the area.	0
Excellent place. The food was outstanding! The sangria was a little disappointing. We sat inside where it was cozy and quiet, but they had a group playing outside for those who wanted a more lively environment.	1
Came here with a friend yesterday for Brunch. Amazing!We both did bottomless mimosas - YAASSWe shared the Waffle Sliders - Bomb!I had the Will's Pan Scramble with Turkey Sausage and Toast - Very good!She had the Short Rib Mac 'n' Cheese grilled cheese with Fries - She was in HeavenService was great, staff were friendly and for brunch it was awesome.There is parking across the alley way behind the restaurant - Free all dayI will definitely come back for lunch and dinner.	1
SOOOOOOOO happy this little gem has moved into the neighborhood. Everything I ate & drank were outstanding!!!	1
Okay, so we went here during summer restaurant week -- so I feel a bit bad scoring so low. But, we went on Thursday night...they had 5 days to perfect the food right? WRONG! The food did not taste remotely good. Everything was so bland, no flavor at all. I was so disappointed that we spent $50 on our meals. Every course was disappointing I had the Gazpacho to start as an appetizer while hubby had corn fritters. Mine was bland and tasteless, said it had avocado in it...literally like 2 small chunks. The corn fritters were globs of grease, just gross. Dinner I had potato dumplings with veggies..just bland, nothing exciting. Hubby had olive oil poached halibut..again nothing to write home about, and very small portion. Desserts were no better, which we were expecting to be since La Brioche does in fact have a great bakery. The best part of the meal was the bread basket...how sad. Our server had no personality or charm -- I even asked her if she was sick of restaurant week or what...she just grunted something back. La Brioche True foods = Truely disappointing.	1
So $90 for 2 people... That&#39;s with 2 glasses of wine that were already half off for happy hour. That&#39;s fine... But when you&#39;re approaching nearly $50 a person... The food better be incredible. The escargot butter parsley sauce was under seasoned and bland. Not once did a server quality check with us in them. The French onion soup was way too sweet... Maybe too much brandy. But no quality check once again. Then the cheese board was fine... But our server(s) did not explain what cheese was what... So it&#39;s just lackluster and lazy... Or just not caring. I hate eating soft cheese with soft bread... It&#39;s so much more enjoyable with a crostini or toasted baguette... I asked a few times and was not warned but charged $3.50 for 2 small baguette slices that were toasted. <br>My partner and I live right here in this neighborhood.. We will not be back.	0
Sorry. Looked super cute. But after waiting 50 mins for a slice of cheese on a plate for $15, we gave up. Thanks for the comped wine, but seriously. Why does it take 25 mins for toasted sliced bread to accompany our cheese, and another 45 mins for hamachi (code for uncooked fish!)? Not our game baby. Not our game!	0
First I just want to say that this review is actually not about the food but the awful service I experienced last Sunday when I stopped in. So I walked in last Sunday with 2 friends around 4pm. The place was surprisingly empty, maybe 2 tables filled and a few people sitting at the bar. I&#39;ve been here a couple of times before and really enjoyed the food. As soon as we walked in the &#34;host&#34; or server not sure exactly tells us that they don&#39;t have a full menu. We say sure no problem since we really just wanted some tapas and wine not a full dinner. He leads us over to one of the main tables in the middle and I asked if we could sit in the corner booth since we had shopping bags. He said &#34;no, that&#39;s only for parties of 4 or more&#34; . I was annoyed since the place was EMPTY!! I would totally understand if it was packed but again there were only 2 tables occupied. But again my friends and I are tired and really wanted some wine. So we said sure no problem and proceed to the table, this is one of those big communal tables in the middle so my friends and I sat down but left the seat at the head of the table empty. The server/host man comes over and asks my friend to please sit at the head of the table. My friend was just confused and he kept insisting that she sit at the head. At this point, I was just completely annoyed at this man for trying to consolidate us into a small corner of the table instead of allowing us to sit comfortably. Again the crazy part about this was that the place was EMPTY!! At that point I did not feel that I should give my money to a place that would treat paying customers in such a rude manner. I was actually a fan of this place but will definitely think twice before I ever step foot in this place again.	0
I really like this spot. It&#39;s a little hidden gem tucked away off the street and it&#39;s a perfect choice as a low-key date spot or a chill first stop on a night out in Little Tokyo or DTLA. <br><br>They have an awesome selection of beer, whiskey, and scotch and they have a great late night happy hour food menu. The tacos are super good. <br><br>You really can&#39;t go wrong.	1
The burger was cooked well and tasted like something I could have made at home. Thus I am torn to give it two stars because the pies was excellent. (Apple &amp; Banana Cream)<br><br>Maybe if I was a BH91201 fan I would have rated this higher. ;)	0
Love this spot! Coca cola asada nachos are the biz! Super chill spot, staff is friendly, beers are awesome. Go check it put if you haven't yet.	1
The burgers here are nothing special, too much lettuce on my burger. Fries, mediocre. Service was okay.	0
Loved the atmosphere, prices reasonable. Nice service	1
This restaurant is in a neat little spot! We wanted to explore a little bit of our Los Angeles and wound up here for dinner. They started us off with chips and homemade salsa. The salsa was delicious! <br><br>The owner and everyone working there were friendly and they gave us the perfect time to think about our options. I ordered a watermelon juice with penne pesto pasta topped with grilled chicken and the boyfriend ordered an horchata with what they call The governor&#39;s plate. His meal came with steak, veggies, and either a small soup of the day which was a tortilla soup or a sald. He chose the tortilla soup and it was divine! His steak was medium well and it was perfect on how they executed it. Some places you say medium well and it comes rare or so. <br><br>I enjoyed my penne pesto and I could not stop munching on it. The grilled chicken was tender and juicy, not dry at all didn&#39;t have that microwave feel to it if you catch my drift. <br><br>Overall, this is a great location owned by a wonderful family! Definitely needs to be checked out by all of those who call LA home!	1
Five-Star taste with five-star service! The restaurant is a little dark but very romantic and you cannot get this great of service and food for this price in Seattle! Menu is about $15-$30/plate.	1
So I ordered take-out from 3 Chefs even after a buddy of mine told me not to ever eat there. I disregarded his advice and was craving chinese food at a fair price. I decided to order the orange chicken with white rice as it seemed safe. The chicken came in huge chunks of soft microwaved tasteless morsles that I immediately stopped eating after one piece. I asked my roommate to try a bite to see if I was crazy. But I am not crazy. That chicken was terrible. The rice was ok, but how can you screw up rice? I will not be coming back here every again. Even if its just for a diet coke.	0
For a person that really doesn&#39;t like fish (there&#39;s something terribly unappetizing about the smell of putrid seawater), I still enjoy an occasional meal at the Fish House. <br><br>The smoked fish spread is addicting and I could probably just eat that on those delicious captain wafers if given the choice.<br><br>The last time I went, I had the pasta with pink sauce (it wouldn&#39;t be fair to call it Vodka sauce...) and shrimp. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the sauce was very tasty. Definitely worth having, especially when it&#39;s offered as a special.<br><br>Our pitcher of beer was a little flat and had a piece of foil from a wine bottle in it, but otherwise it was reasonably priced and not worth complaining too much about.<br><br>I think my biggest pet peeve with Fish House is the music. In one room they usually have some crappy live band playing terrible covers or even worse, original songs. And if the gods find it favorable and you&#39;re lucky enough to be seated far away from said crappy band, prepare to endure XM&#39;s Best of the &#39;60&#39;s station directly competing with the house music. Is this type of torture absolutely necessary, Fish House? <br><br>Anyway, aside from that, the place is really comfortable and relaxing to eat at so definitely give it a try. :)	1
Located at the top of Pershing Square, this is a quaint lounge/bar with a 1960's aura of elegance and sass. The waiters and bartenders were all super cute with their bow-tie outfits, pinstripe slacks and wing-toe loafers.I'd stay away on the weekends because it gets so damn packed, but the perfect weeknight spot for light drinks and catch up with the girls. Try duck, duck, goose with the French Cab as you stare off into the starry night, you'll forget you're in LA and think you're somewhere in Europe.	1
Haven&#39;t had the food yet because I&#39;ve been waiting for 2 hours when they said it would be an hour wait. They need to fix their management and learn how to seat tables correctly. It&#39;s not rocket science. Too bad as I had high hopes for this place.	0
Monday Night Supper! Love this place... They have the Monday special which includes appetizer, entree and dessert for $15. Everything on their menu is very good. The inside bar area is really cool with some nice drinks on the menu. I used to frequent here all the time when I lived in Los Feliz. Will be back for sure!	1
Placed an order trough GrubHub at Meat, order went through, money was withdrawn from my account, no food. Over an hour later I checked the status of my order, it said my food was being prepared. Sometime later I received a call from GrubHub. The representative provided a half-hearted apology and stated that the restaurant closed after accepting my order and taking my money... So now it&#39;s late, my money will not be reimbursed for several days, and I have no food... Poor customer service on the part of Meat to a first/last time customer, and terrible customer service on the part of GrubHub to a regular/former customer. Very disappointing and unprofessional! Shame on you Meat and GrubHub!!!!!	0
I always want to like this place because it&#39;s so convenient if you intend to go out after dinner, but quite frankly it&#39;s just not that good and the service is really not that nice.	0
I've just been there for lunch, but the soup was tasteless, I don't want to go anymore. Disappointed!	0
My girl had mentioned she had a certificate to the corner . We live so close by , that I decided to join her . The service was amazing . Thanks to terry , I was able to taste the pork sandwich (can't remember the full name.. Lol) but dammmm was it good . The only thing I would've like is to have a pitcher of mimosas vs the server coming every few times to refill on the bottom less . For that reason I give it 4 and not 5 . Besides that , all was dope ...	1
I was looking to a place to grab some breakfast in between classes and I soon as I walked in D&#39;oro I was welcomed by Luciana. She was really nice and explained the menu for me. I sat on the outdoors are which is really nice despite that is in the middle of Downtown. The food was delicious and the coffee was great. The price was reasonable for the food quality and the ambience. I would totally come back to D&#39;Oro.	1
I try and go here once a week; they literally have the best pastrami ruben I have ever had, and that's coming from someone who lived in a few hassidic areas in the past (typically these places breed great delis). Seriously though, they are infinitely better than Langer's and all the other places that people seem to rave about in LA. There just isn't anything better if you are looking for something reminiscent of an NY deli and are prepared for one of the best sandwich experiences of your life. Oh, and their baked goods and bagels are pretty good too.	1
On a recent visit with my family to Local 360 we were asked to wait 10-15 minutes for a table because of a server shortage. After 15 minutes we were seated only to wait another 20 minutes with no service. The restaurant was not that busy. Without rambling on the concept here is good. The food is not too bad. The service is terrible. We even wrote to the management staff and never received a reply. There are plenty of great restaurants out there folks. Don't be fooled. Try Tilikum Place Cafe if you want to be in Belltown. Great food and service!	0
I had been wanting to treat my partner to his first pho experience for a while now and could not wait any longer to do so. I searched up places at 11 pm hoping for a place to be open and read that they offered Thai food here as well, how amazing! If he did not like pho then I knew he was a huge Thai lover just in case. Even though it was a bit out of our way we went and now it has become a regular spot and we love coming here. I have had better pho and more specifically Thai food at other places but for the price and the hospitality we always get when we go there, you can&#39;t beat it.	1
My overall experience was terrible. Not only did the waiter give me the wrong fries, the ketchup bottle was disgustingly dripping in ketchup with a weak pouring spout that fell off and spilled all over my food. Not to mention there was a fly in my water. Disappointed but I guess everyone else has different experiences.	0
The salmon is always amazing!!<br>This place has a great vibe for the after work crowd. <br><br>The Bulldog is my favorite drink, just enough sweet and just enough spicy. <br>The servers are attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. <br><br>One thing to watch is the valet though. Had something stolen from my car and they refused to return it. Annoying because there is no real street parking, so make sure that your stuff is locked up. <br><br>-Bryan	1
I&#39;m giving 2stars b/c I&#39;m happy to have a bar near my apt. and the atmosphere was nice. But the food needs some serious help. The lemon pepper poached shrimp was ok, the andouille sausage po boy was average but the blackened catfish po boy was inedible. I&#39;m chalking this one up to first week jitters. At least I hope that&#39;s all it was.	0
It is to be expected that a place in this locale would be touristy, and indeed it is. However, the vendors here put other food courts to shame. Can&#39;t make it to Smorgasburg? Want to try some of the most popular businesses in the city, in one place? Hudson Eats might be the choice for you.<br><br>Num Pang, Black Seed, Mighty Quinn, and Dos Toros are all here, churning out the same quality product you get at their other locations. <br><br>There is plenty of seating, whether at a booth, table, or high-top, and it is all super clean. <br><br>Unlike a traditional mall food court, this is a bit more high end, but not unaffordable. <br><br>I&#39;m a fan despite the slack-jawed clientele, simply because I can get a bagel, some brisket, a cupcake, and a hoisin meatball sandwich without having to travel to four separate brick-and-mortar joints. Viva good eats and gluttony.	1
Very chick, modern little place downtown LV .... Love the open space and the food is absolutely good!!!! Don&#39;t miss out on the pasta with currants, anchovy almond dish, it&#39;s really good	1
Hmm I guess Hunters just wasn&#39;t a great match for me. I found the cocktails to leave much to be desired, especially with Clover Club being directly across the street. I expected more from the food as well, given the great reviews. I ordered the Kale salad to start, followed by striped bass with faro, wanting to dine on the healthy side. The Kale salad was excellent, though heavy for a salad. I would have been happy if that were my entree, even shared. Then came the bass. I was expecting it to be prepared light and fresh, yet instead found a bass masked behind way too much butter, salt, and cream. I could hardly eat half, and a week later, I still feel a bit sick thinking about it. Yes it is winter, and the theme of the restaurant is a rustic, animal heavy place. But I found myself searching with my fork for a bite of something less engorged in fat and salt, which is never a good sign. In my opinion, good food should not have to hide behind the flavors of fat and salt; they should rather be used to highlight the flavors of quality natural ingredients. I am not butter-phobic by any means, but I left here feeling heavy, and could taste the cream on my tongue for the next hour after my meal. Unfortunately, Hunters was not for me. But if you&#39;re looking for a heavy meal with huge portion sizes and interesting food, maybe it&#39;s your kind of place.	0
Authentic Mexican restaurant with high quality , fresh ingredients from local farmers. Eric is very thoughtful and passionate about his restaurant. His recommendation scored high with me and my 10 year old girl. It&#39;s a fun, unpretentious place with a pool table and cool vibes. Really delicious food and creative menu. You should try the Asada Fries and get a taste of Heaven!	1
Right, first off let me start off by saying that this rating is for my most recent visit to the Blue cow, and if I were to exclude this I&#39;d give Blue cow about a 4 1/2 star rating overall. That being said, my last visit was a pretty big and long series of blunders on the part of Blue cow staff and management. <br><br>I went to Blue cow on Oct 21st to get a burger (mario style). I had called ahead to order to go and walked over. The food was ready when I arrived but unfortunately the payment systems were down. No biggie I thought since my server Paul was rushing around to different stations to get it done. However, it took over 20 minutes to finally pay for my food, and of course, by the time I got down to eating my burger, it was cold. I was offered an apology but nothing else. Well, not really the restaurant&#39;s fault and I was pretty much ready to forgive this one transgression.<br><br>Unfortunately, this was not the end of it. Checking my credit card statement online a few days later, I discovered that I had been double charged for my burger. I promptly called Blue cow to get a refund and was assured by the manager (John) that it&#39;d be taken care of and that I&#39;d receive a phone call back once it was done. A week later I&#39;d still not gotten a call or a refund. <br><br>I was once again eating in the Water Court so I decided to pay visit in person and asked to speak with the manager (think her name was Michelle) to get a refund. Wrote down all my credit card information, and once again, was promised a phone call and refund. Once again, nothing.<br><br>Finally had to call my credit card company to dispute the charge and congrats Blue cow, you finally made me sign up for yelp and post my very first review.	0
LOVE these guys!!! The soy garlic wings are fraking WIN.	1
Horrible waitstaff, they barely responded at all. The food was abysmal, the authentic chinese food was awful, and the american-chinese food was tasteless and both are expensive. Do not go.	0
We were surprised to learn that Bouchon has been in Vegas for 12 years. The food and service were excellent. Much better than Bouchon in Beverly Hills. Our wiatress Arlene was great and made our dining experience even better.	1
Fortunately, I don&#39;t rate foods on authenticity. Unfortunately, I still wouldn&#39;t recommend this restaurant to anyone in the middleteranean or elsewhere.	0
I am ambivalent about Paper or Plastik. --On the one hand, the inside looks a lot like Colectivo Coffee by the lake in Milwaukee (the old flushing station), which made me feel very at home. (Other reviewers are calling the decor "hipster." I think that's cute--what is normal to Milwaukeeans is hipster to Angelinos). --On the other hand, the prices are outrageous. A cup of coffee for over $4? Really? On what planet is ordering a latte over a cup of coffee a cost-saving measure? Oh, Los Angeles, you kill me. --But the blueberry pop tart pastry is yumtastic. --But the breakfast plate, while good, is $12, and a bowl of soup is $11. (The guy next to me ate only a little bit of his soup because it reminded him of baby food. I didn't try it).--But the sweet potato & French feta sandwich is tasty and unique. I wouldn't have come up with that combination, and it really really worked. See why I'm torn?	1
Spectacular food, the best Gnochis ever. The food was amazing fresh and delicious. As for the service it is not run of the mill family restaurant the owner is running around and relatives are making sure your food and dining experience is good. Would recommend hands down..	1
Great. Old school. Jewish Deli. I came here for lunch and got a Pastrami sandwich to go, so I can't attest to the sit-down experience. Up front they have a deli counter and pastry counter for people getting food to go. Then in the back they have a big dining room with an old school counter. The Pastrami sandwich was very good. Soft, flavorful rye bread and thinly sliced meat (much thinner than Langer's). The mustard was good and the sandwich was pretty stacked. This sandwich is a little bit small overall (diameter-wise) compared to some others. This isn't my favorite in town, but I'd take it as a solid lunch option.When I was waiting for my sandwich, I was captivated by the pastry counter. In a moment of incredible sugar-induced weakness, I ended up buying an enormous apple turnover and a Black and White cookie.The turnover was ABSOLUTELY incredible. Possibly the best turnover I've ever had. Apples were tender, crust was flaky. Sweet but not too sweet. And there was possibly an entire pound of butter in my turnover alone. Thumbs way up. However, as a connoisseur of fine NY-style Black and White cookies, I can tell you: this one sucked, haha. It was really dry on the inside. Hardly the scrumptious yellow cake cookie that you expect. The frosting was okay, but without a solid cookie base, what do you have?	1
Really!? that's how many chips I get? Really!? So, basically I have to order seventeen orders of chips and salsa to get what's normally given as one order. Anyway, I'm in the hood and ate here like twenty times and though always thought it pretty good, but nothing special, I was always annoyed at service, which was done with an indelible frown, and their 75 percent screw up my order rate. Just competent unauthentic Mexican food, who screw up my to go order and seem to have severe chip shortage, I mean your only job is to make like five different meals that consist of the same basic six ingredients, I can't imagine it's that hard, but somehow the meal is always wrong??!!. I now go to Chihuahua's in my hood, but really, the Mission is still the place!!	0
I eat here at least 3 times a week. I work close by and it&#39;s my immediate go to. Everything is affordable and great quality food. The guy Manuel that runs it makes you feel like you&#39;re at home. And you can&#39;t beat 99cent tacos after 5pm	1
So freaking good and Authentic. Service with a smile doesn&#39;t come naturally, a little of attitude is served on the side, BUT, juicy burgers compensate for the lack of courtesy anywhere I go!	1
Regardless of the criteria by which you judge POT--food, service, value, ambiance--it will woefully let you down if you have ever been to any half decent Korean place before. My dining companion described the experience as being forced to ride a child's tricycle, after already completing the Tour de France. Every flavor is muted. The personalities of the staff are muted. The lighting is muted. The bill, however, screamed: $73 for lunch, no beverages. Avoid at all cost-there isn't enough concrete or pretension in the world to save this place.	0
I'm really a fan of this place. Not only is it open 24 hours but it's also got a crazy good selection of beef broths, soups, jigaes and more. We ordered the oxtail soup, the beef shortrib soup (galbitang) and the spicy pork neck stew (gamjatang). All of them were hits. I could eat here every week. I think pricing was somewhat on the higher side however, which is why it's not a 5-star rating in my book.	1
Delicious, I love the food, the vibe, the people, this is a great place to eat a burger, relax, and take a quick pause before heading back out into the LA fray.	1
It's ok. Nothing spectacular, nothing horrible. Ordered salad, pate, and pork belly apps-nothing really blew us away but it wasn't terrible. Steak frites and rabbit leg again meh, I've had better, I've had worse. I'm not sure if I would go back.	0
A good break from the norm, The Original Big Tomato serves up some of Miamis best deep dish pizza. Most the pies are in a personal size around a twelve inches and also a medium pie if you want to share. They have a wide selections of toppings and specialty pizzas to choose from. They also have a bunch of soups and sandwiches on the menu and some good drinks like Dr. Browns soda. Its mostly take out here but they have seating for about ten people. <br>If you feel like you need a break fron NY style slices and want some good deep dish this is the spot	1
Good coffee, good sandwiches and all day breakfast.	1
I had the Dynamic Duo- a 5 oz crab cake and 3 jumbo shrimp. I love shrimp, it is one of my favorite things to eat so I was excited to eat jumbo shrimp. The shrimp, however came out butterflied and flat. This can be great for cooking them faster, but for me, it almost always results in over cooked, rubbery, tasteless shrimp. So that was a disappointment. The crab cake, was however, the best one I have ever eaten.  My husband, who is allergic to fish, indulged me by coming along. There are non-fish options, more than at some other seafood places we've tried. He got a steak and, while it came out to his specified done-ness, the meat itself was bland. The atmosphere is nice. We chose to avoid the toll way, so the drive from PG county was a bit long and the area looks kinda questionable at night (we had to drive through an industrial section to get there). There is free parking and the restaurant itself and the parking lot is well lit and attended, so that was a bonus.  All in all, I wasn't angry that we chose to eat there but I don't think we'll be going back.	0
This space delivers on service and food with portions to please all. The staff has a sense of humor and are helpful as you navigate a menu with so much to choose.  The asparagus fries are crispy, steaks tender, salad plentiful, so don't over do it or you won't have room for dessert as I did. Oh well next time for the sweets!	1
The burgers are pretty tasty, however, the service here (as at the other Umami I have been to, in Toluca Lake) is chock full of pretension and rudeness. I ordered three burgers to go and the bill came to over $34. The prices are truly exorbitant. The restaurant was deserted when I came to pickup my order, but it still seemed like I was inconveniencing the bartender. After establishing that mine was their sole order at the time. He slammed my bill down as he went to shove my burgers in a brown paper bag the likes of which my mother used to pack my PB&Js in when I was five. He then took my payment and didn't give me a receipt (which I needed since I was ordering for work). When I asked for it he said, "I gave it to you, right?" Wrong. Of course this irritated him and after sighing loudly he managed to do his job and print the receipt, which was also slammed down on the bar. I took my sack of food and got the heck out of there as fast as possible.My manly burger retained the lingering taste of rudeness. The food probably would've been better if I hadn't had to deal with the diva bartender. I guess no one told him he works at a burger place. He reeked of entitlement (like every other Umami employee I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with) and it tainted my lunch.There's a Jack In The Box nearby I would recommend going there instead, at least their food isn't overpriced, you get speedy service, and it usually comes with a smile.	0
REALLY GOOD!! Pizza was great, staff was awesome, wings are crazy good (grilled, not fried which is amazing!) and that&#39;s pretty much all there is to say. I think the prices were decent, I had a medium pizza and 5 or 10 wings (can&#39;t remember) and I paid like $20.. That really isn&#39;t that bad considering the quality ingredients they use and the prices of other pizza places.. Definitely worth trying. I love the fact that the this is probably the healthiest pizza place ever.	1
This place was recommended by a few friends so I thought we should check it out. Once we sat down and looked at the menu's I realized we were basically in a Chili's or an Applebee's Plus. Friendly waiter made it better. The food average and cost more than it should. About an hour after dinner I had to run to the toilet. Not good. Something I ate there is dying to get out. Totally sharted a few minutes ago. WTF! We spent $60 on one beer a kid's meal, a steak, and a burger with fries. And I have diarrhea now. Don't think I'll be going back. Seems popular though. Not sure why.	0
Very nice place, great atmosphere but the services was not good at all and very pricy	0
I REALLY like this place! It is a great lunch spot and the hummus ROCKS. I like the sausage dishes the best and have not expanded my choices. But my dining companions always seem to enjoy whatever they order from the menu as well. It is a bit chilly in there sometimes, but well worth going to. Since things are made on the spot it can take a bit of time to get your order....but it is worth every bite!	1
Favorite all time deli. The food & bakery all very good!	1
One word: delicious!	1
man oh man, this place was a disaster. made a reservation for this past friday night - the host and hostess were very nice, but swamped; we were seated about 30 minutes late. attempted to get a drink at the bar while we were waiting and were ignored. the host intervened and got the bartender&#39;s attention, and even then we still had to wait.. oh well.<br><br>the service was totally abysmal, though our server was very nice. waited over 20 minutes to place our order for dinner, and my order arrived incorrect despite being clear with our server. waited another 30 minutes for a round of drinks which came out AFTER our food.. after we had asked 3 different people what the status of our drinks was since our server was MIA. the food itself was fine, but the place was so dark i could barely see what i was eating. and then once we finished dinner ANOTHER repeat round of drinks came out which we thankfully got comped because it was a miscommunication.<br><br>and the icing on the cake.. once we got home, i was sick all night and well into saturday with food poisoning. great date night! needless to say, we will never go to this place again.<br><br>i&#39;d give it 0 stars if i could, but the hosts were doing the best they could with the tables, and the head waiter was very courteous and got things done. the view is very nice but the table we had was practically in the pool. i&#39;d like my money back, please.	0
How do you rate or review an experience like this? It almost seems sacrilege to criticize someone who has invited you into their literal home for dinner. But I&#39;ll give this review my best shot. I usually hate esoteric food reviews, but I&#39;ll probably end up drifting that way anyway.<br><br>Craig and company really care about what they do. This isn&#39;t just some grind or cash-grab they&#39;re doing. He&#39;s described Wolvesmouth as wanting to put together a band and it seems that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s done. They harmonize and make a great experience together. I&#39;ve never been so close to the action. They invite you to walk around while they work, look at what they&#39;re doing, get as close as you want without being an obstruction. It isn&#39;t so much of a dining experience as it is an education into what goes into a three-star quality meal.<br><br>I had a 6:30PM seating and we were treated to nine courses. The long dining table accommodated about 20 people. I got to know some really interesting guests and share conversation with them. It seemed as soon as our meal started, it was nearly over. Where did the time go? Trust me, you will ask yourself this same question. Three hours flew by and we were treated to some gorgeous and delicious platings.<br><br>I&#39;m not much of a sweet or dessert person, but the dessert courses were among my favorite. The cookie/biscuits they created and integrated with my peanut-butter and toasted marshmallow panna cotta were phenomenal. The way they coax a soft, but firm crunch out of the cookie without being overly moist or dry. It&#39;s airy, but dense. It&#39;s toothy, but not abrasive. It really is one of the top dishes I&#39;ve had in my life.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t make sense for me to give a play-by-play for all these courses we were served. They were diverse. They had range. They didn&#39;t necessarily follow any pattern I could detect, but that is not a criticism. They were all incredible and packed full of innovation.<br><br>The people were great. I wish I had more time to get to know them better, or exchanged contact information. The food was satiating and amazing. The earthquake was slightly jolting but unifying. The decor was one of a kind and intimate. <br><br>Strongly considering buying myself an early June birthday present in the form of a ticket to their Cut Your Teeth collaboration with Matthew Bone. I have full trust in Craig and his team and would love another opportunity to get to know them, their passions, and meet other types of company they keep. A truly unique dining experience.	1
Good looking place, with decent apps - but the service was awful.  The waitress literally walked away mid-drink order, twice.  My date and I had to focus on what we were going to say before she came back, because she was on a comet-like cycle.  Seemed like years.  And when we did get her attention we needed to get it ALL in, or else we would have to wait for another trip around the sun.  Very nerve wracking.  Looking around at the other waitresses I figured it out - they were all busing as well as waitressing.  Clearing plates, wiping tables, setting tables.  Plus the waitressing.  They couldn't keep up; something had to give.  Having said that, I've never had someone walk away mid-order like that before - much less do it twice.	0
The food is really good here. Been a couple times. Each time I come, I have a different experience, but overall, I'd have to give it 4 out of 5 stars. Their food is good, but not always consistent, so I can't really push for that 5th star. Nevertheless, worth coming here to catch up with a friend, or a casual lunch with someone.	1
I&#39;m in love with this spot! <br>It was simply by chance that we came in. Needed to get away from the blistering cold and it happened to be close to the L train. <br>We ordered the Shrimp-Po Boy Sandwich, Kale salad &amp; plenty of yummy beer. <br><br>The food was scrumptious. <br>The service was friendly, fast and enjoyable. <br>Our server was such a cool guy. <br>The decor had a WOW factor. The art work, light fixtures, booths, cute random gnome, was interesting and conversation worthy. You can tell a lot of thought went into <br>each and every detail. Loved it! <br><br>I think I&#39;m coming back again for brunch tomorrow. :-)	1
We have ordered several times from this place.... its good and reasonably priced. Yummy boba and the sandwich combos are ideal for lunch.	1
I am a huge fan of this place! Their portions are huge and prices are reasonable. Their kimchi jjigae is my favorite. There is tons of meat in the jjigae (best part, in my opinion)!<br><br>Their juns (Korean pancake?) are also large and cheap! <br><br>Also tried their LA galbi (short ribs). They were good, but I would stick with their jjigae and juns for the most part. I have yet to try to boodae jjigae but it looks great.<br><br>Only reason I give it 4 stars is because I wish they had more servers! The place is getting more popular than when it first opened. Today was like fourth time there, and it was the busiest I&#39;ve seen them. With only two servers running the place, it was hard to get their attention and service wasn&#39;t too great.. <br><br>In any case, would still recommend!	1
The gumbo had no flavor and the Cajun fries were undercooked.	0
Solid.I wasn't extremely impressed with their drinks (I tried the mango mojito...eh), but the fun atmosphere, friendly service and good food made up for it. The homemade s'more dessert is such a great idea, and they were delicious and messy just like s'mores should be!	1
Great service from Jonathan ! The grill chicken cartilage , beef tataki , bacon wrap mushroom , gizzard , are just a few great appetizer ! I Definitely <br>will come back with good friends for great food !	1
The coffee is distinctly different from most other places which can either be a plus or a minus depending on your coffee pallette. I personally don't care for the flavor but I could see others enjoying it.	0
I went here to meet some buddies on a Sunday evening. We went here due to all the good yelp reviews and overall, we weren't disappointed. We got there around 7:30pm and sat in the outside part of the bar. The bar itself is pretty large with a large indoor section and an outdoor section with heat lamps. It was cold outside but the heat lamps worked well and sitting outside was worth it. Although it was Sunday, they still offered us the happy hour prices which was really cheap. Their happy hour food options were really cheap as well. However, I'm lowering it one star only because the food wasn't especially great, but I can't say it was horrible for bar food either. Overall, the service was good and the vibe was also nice. A really mixed crowd with some young and older folks. If I lived in the area, I would definitely go here more regularly. I will definitely head back if we're looking for a place to hangout in the area.	1
I went here once before and loved it. It was the best meal I&#39;ve ever had in New York <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FCity.so&amp;s=5afffd5227ded5ed072ece0de8b60ac77761a6e159abfd34ed58e0b165c4d945" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">City.so</a> I bought my friends from Perth here in their four day stay in nyc. <br><br>We came on their first night, and unfortunately for all of us, three hours after the meal we were violently ill. It took two full days to recover, and I called to let them know because I think it is such a fantastic restaurant. However no one bothered to call me back. I really wanted them to because I desperately want to like this place again.<br><br>I hope it was a one off and never happens again as my first experience was brilliant.	0
Surprisingly small venue but a nice enough place for a sunday brunch. Imagine a nighttime view would be nice with lights but daytime was pretty much meh.<br>Service was smooth and friendly, we enjoyed eggs and biscuits that were tasty. The carafe of mimosas won us over though.<br>While reservations are recommended we didn&#39;t find it too busy at 11am on Sunday. Oh and it&#39;s a bit of a hunt to actually arrive at the rooftop; I know you&#39;d think that would be the easy part. :)	1
I've found myself at Doughroom quite a few times when visiting a friend in Palms. I love the food, the beer list (both draft and bottled) is pretty solid, and the ambience reminds me of many places I love in Brooklyn. It's a great neighborhood joint and is the perfect little date spot.I've had a few of their pizzas - Bianco and Flying Pig were both pretty great. I had the pappardelle with bolognese on my last visit and that was super delicious. I hear the calzones are to die for and I've heard great things about the garlic knots. Definitely a well balanced menu executed right.I think I'm always up for a visit because of their rotating craft beer list. I just had the Drake flight, which was a variety of five beers for $16. A bit pricey for a flight, but it did not disappoint :)It seems like they are trying extra hard to boost the service too, so kudos to them! The manager (or owner?) was extremely attentive on my visit last night. I already know I will be back!	1

In attempt to make up for leaving his dirty socks everywhere (I finally reached my limit) my husband and I had lunch at Gramercy Tavern today. <br><br>Just as I do not understand why my husband can&#39;t put his socks away, I do not get the hype about Gramercy Tavern. In any case, my husband now has two things to make up for: leaving his socks everywhere and taking me for a sub-par lunch for leaving his socks everywhere.<br><br>Ambiance: Let&#39;s start with the good. This place is beautiful! The decor is really just stunning, kind of like Tavern in Brentwood, CA (maybe the same owners?) but less packed. Open, airy, spacious. <br><br>Service: Can&#39;t complain. Servers were on it at all times.<br><br>Food: Mostly terrible.<br><br>*Warm Lobster Salad - The lobster was very chewy and the portion was tiny for $18. I was utterly underwhelmed with the lack of salt and flavor.<br><br>*Cauliflower Soup - Not my thing at all. The soup had a strange bitter taste. My husband seemed okay with it. Or maybe he was too scared to say anything?<br><br>* Smoked Arctic Char - This entree was almost not edible. The smoked flavor was just too much...it tasted like smoked salmon (which I love) but magnified 10 times. It was just wrong.<br><br>* Halibut - Finally something tasty! My husband ordered this as his main and it was nearly perfect. I loved the tomato water and the potatoes. The eggplant was a bit greasy but I&#39;m splitting hairs here.<br><br>So maybe my palate isn&#39;t elevated enough or something but seriously, I wished I was at Chipotle during the entire lunch, where I could have had 5 burrito bowls for the price of my chewy lobster and too-smoky char.<br><br>Obviously I&#39;m the only one on Yelp who feels this way but I (and my husband) have no plans to return to Gramercy Tavern.	0
It was our daughter's 21st birthday and she selected the restaurant as one of her favorites.  Our table chef was very entertaining, with swift knife skills and amusing routines.  We had the basic chicken teriyaki with various additional proteins, eg, i had scallops, husband had beef and shrimp.  All was delicious and plentiful!	1
Try the resturant week menu, the food is good. Love the cheese cake, short rib and pasta.Chicken is ok nothing special.	1
Cute place right in the heart of LACMA.<br>Service was good, but food/dessert was overpriced and HORRIBLE! Really, I literally wanted to stop at one bite... <br>If I ever go back, I will just have to get their drinks!	0
People here are extremely nice, which is the reason why I upped this an extra star. Poke here though is a bit mediocre. I do have a quick little theory though about the fact that this place wasn&#39;t as good as the other Poke I&#39;ve been too here in Vegas, well the thing is, we came in here about 10 minutes before this place was about to close. But if you own a poke spot you&#39;re expected to have fresh fish all the way up to when you close, so I can&#39;t really use that too much of an excuse. Just like I said this place is great though, people that run this tiny poke spot are really really courteous, nice, and everything else that goes along those lines of words.<br><br>We ordered the usual stuff just more of it because we just came here right before we left back home to the bay. We came here to bring a bunch of poke because we don&#39;t have anything like that around the bay. Anyways we had the squid, ahi garlic, and pretty much all the other ahi flavors. I might come back here and give this place another shot just because how awesome the owners are here and my theory about coming to this place late might be right.<br><br>Owners keep up the friendly service. Service really matters when coming to any place!	1
Finally! A great sushi restaurant in LIC. look no further. They are best in class and take great care in bringing high quality product to the customer. Thank you for coming to LIC.	1
I&#39;ve been to downtown several times but never thought of eating around the area until now. It seems like the only area to eat around here are the street hot dog carts and the McDonalds until my friend pointed out a sign that said food court. Being that it&#39;s Good Friday and we can&#39;t eat meat we thought we&#39;d try to see if they had something to offer that didn&#39;t contain meat. The guy at the counter offered a vegetarian burger. <br><br>The burger contained a fried potato patty with lettuce, tomato, cheese, and grilled onion. It came with a side of French fries with basil sprinkled on it. The best part that really gave it a kick was their basil garlic sauce. Whenever I&#39;m in the area I&#39;ll def come back to eat here again but on a day where I can eat meat.<br><br>Also my friend ordered a strawberry banana with whip cream. She had me try it and it was good.	1
I went there for brunch at the service was TERRIBLE. The food was ok. I would describe at best as a glorified Squat and Gobble. There was a line but empty tables. We waited over 15 minutes for our drinks and where never asked again if we wanted another one. I had heard so many great things about this place. And while I would like to give it a 2nd chance I can no longer tolerate bad service in this city. There are too many gems to hang out in the rough	0
The best Indian food I've had. Service was excellent. This is our new go-to place. EDIT Went back a second time and had the buffet and I advise against it. Only a couple of items and it wasn't replenished while we were there.	1
We love coming here when we prefer more specialised items than the unimaginative platter of American-style carbs for breakfast/brunch. Of course you&#39;ll be paying a little more than boring diner prices but it&#39;s worth every penny! Their food is cooked hot off the stove and nothing tastes like it was a day old or has been reheated from a frozen pack.<br><br>Because I dislike greasy sausage and eating eggs in the morning, I was happy that I could order a much healthier lean chicken paillard at 9am and not get strange looks at Theresa&#39;s. Yep, I&#39;m one of those people who likes to order the offbeat things that don&#39;t go with the normal flow of the schedule or house specialty. The chicken paillard of course was delicious and admittedly, quite a lot of food for the price. Tea is not complimentary since they serve better name brand tea flavours besides Lipton but that&#39;s fine with me.<br><br>Everyone comes here like they know each other but that shouldn&#39;t be a deterant for newcomers--the waitstaff still treats you with the same warmness and attentative service they do with the regulars who are also superfriendly themselves. The place attracts a lot of couples which makes for a good spot for romantic breakfasts or brunches. It&#39;s quite amusing how popular this place is with the gorgeous neighbourhood, which also is a visual treat in itself for a scenic stroll.	1
Their main dishes (esp Jun-Bok-Jook) are all really good. Also they only give you 3 or 4 ban-chans but they are all sooooo good, esp jang-jo-rim :)They only have few tables so you may have to wait.	1
Great place. Really good food all around. Best mexican place in this neighborhood so far. I wish they closed a bit later.	1
I probably come here 2 times a month. I come here when I want a sure thing, or a place to drink with friends (byob). Service is usually really good, food is always great, minus the tamales.	1
I would actually give them 2.5 stars, but rounded up...From the moment we walked in without reservations, we never once felt particularly welcome. After much sighing and carrying on by the hostess- and eventually the manager- we were told they would 'squeeze us in.' We're talking 5p because we had a toddler in tow and only one other table had patrons...Anyway, we loved the idea of ordering various small plates. Not one single dish was amazing. The mixed greens salad and the flat iron steak were both very good. The saffron chicken and the fiery prawns were good, but nothing special. Same for the Alki pizza- the crust is very good, but the toppings are just meh. The biggest issue we had with the food is that it came out in stages, with two of the items arriving after we'd completely finished the rest of the meal. No apologies or anything. It's obvious that the place is understaffed (just the manager and 2 waitresses- all of whom are spending ample time socializing). Everything is overpriced, even by Seattle standards. $3-4 for a soda from a can?! The menu states that most diners order 3-4 small plates, but at a minimum of $9 a pop, that's just absurd. The charcuterie small plate, for example, is $16! When we asked the waitress if they offered a half portion, she said, 'oh, it's already really small...' Again, some of our food items were pretty good, but won't likely return...	0
This place is ridiculously priced. I'm from San Diego, so I know good Mexican food, and didn't expect much from this place but this was even worse than I expected. I got a crane Asada quesadilla and it 1) cost ten bucks and 2) was tiny! I can get a way bigger and way yummier one for less than half the price back in SD. And even if sd is closer to the border, this food here just sucks and is way overpriced for the little amount you get. One good this is the hot sauce that came with it and the chips. Weird to dip chips in because it's not exactly salsa, but the flavor was good!	0
My go-to spot. Food, booze &amp; service are great. Feels like home. Outdoor seating. Go.	1
Terrible service. People that got seated after us and ordered after were served first. We waited for a long time for our food. The appetizer we ordered was amazing. It was cheese and bread basically. Then we got to the pizza. It was the most bitter thing I&#39;ve had in a very long time. It made me cringe, I would not go to this place again. The only thing that I loved was the interior design.	0
Went to lunch with some other mail carriers Saturday to try this new place out. The five of us each ordered something different. I got a steak sandwich. My other coworkers got a grilled cheese (which I tried and was very flavorful), chicken panini, pastrami panini, and I can&#39;t remember what that other sandwich was! There was not a single complaint! Everyone enjoyed their meal and the owner took care of us, which we were all greatly appreciative of! I brought a couple menus back home with me to tell everyone about Great American Food. Can&#39;t wait to try something else there next time!	1
after reading several reviews, I was looking forward to dining at BLT. upon promptly arriving for our 7:00 PM reservation we were greeted by the hostesses and had about 10 minute wait for our table (no too bad for Christmas night). while being seated, I noticed we were pretty close to the neighboring tables, a bit uncomfortable to have a romantic dinner, but okay. our server for the night was Juan (could have been Jose) and he was pleasant. I being a meat eater ordered a bone-in NY Steak and my wife being a seafood lover, but wanting to try their meats, ordered their bone-in Rib Eye. we both ordered our steaks Medium. for our sides (all entree' are ala carte) we ordered the &quot;Fingerling Potatoes&quot; and an order of their creamy spinach. we were given a &quot;compliments from the chef&quot; toasted baguettes with a duck liver pate/glace which was delicious. after quite a while (maybe 45 minutes) our main dishes arrived and needless to say we were very disappointed. first off, my steak arrived well done (no pink) and dry, and also without a bone. I don't know if it's their way of serving the NY steak, but mine was also &quot;chopped&quot; into 5 chunks and like I mentioned, it didn't have a bone. going on to my wife's meal, the rib-eye did come with a bone and her's came med-well (very little pink) just to mention; both steaks did come with white plastic &quot;Medium&quot; cow shaped picks. my Bearnaise dipping sauce (for an up charge) was good, but my wife's &quot;Peppercorn sauce&quot; was bland. as for the &quot;fingerling potatoes&quot; they were basically over cooked fried baked potato wedges with some kind of sauce drizzled on top. the only items we enjoyed were the spinach and the complimentary Pop overs. in my opinion for the price, I would skip BLT and go to Ruth Chris or Morton's... stay away!	0
Trendy, ridiculously crowded, service is a little uneven, and kind of pricey. Ridiculously crowded needs to be emphasized, as there&#39;s ALWAYS a line for a table.<br><br>It redeems itself, though-- the food is quite good (The Oscar, the Protein, two create-your-own-omelets, and something else were all quite good) although the bread is rather ordinary, and the people watching is excellent if you&#39;re too young for the crowd at Urth Cafe or some other spots.<br><br>Not to mention the outside seating, well, we were seated right by the entrance, so we had seriously good people watching position. It&#39;s not somewhere I would go regularly, but on a beautiful morning like this morning to a place I only rarely frequent, it was worth a visit.	1
I had really really high expectations because i loveee korean fried chicken and this place did not disappoint. Ordered the bool dak with cheese (obvs) but because i have a kind of weird stomach i went with level 1. It wasn't really spicy and i wish i went for level 2, but it makes me wonder how the levels can jump so much??? Also ordered the chicken wings and man oh man. So good!!!! They were so crispy and juicy (also extremely hot) and delicious... Definitely felt a little overpriced. This place definitely goes better with beer and than any other types of alcohol imo. Only downside was that they were put of hoegaarden :(	1
We had a very frustrating experience tonight and will never visit again.  To be fair to the establishment, we had been told that we could bring a bottle of wine and it turns out that that is against their policy.  So, no big deal, right?  Hell, no.	0
Great place. Great food. Good pricing. Very nice staff. We are more than happy to come back. Great veggie options. Nice salads. Silent lounge music. And they have Gibli movies on three big screens. What more could u ask for?	1
Cute cafe! I love their display of pastries and to-go meals. Their yogurt parfaits are definitely one of my faves. I wish they were closer for my morning coffee runs. <br><br>I will definitely be back for more :)	1
This place is excellent. The atmosphere is welcoming and the staff are very personable. The steak frites is always great and there is a very nice selection of french wines by the glass. It is refreshing to see a small by-the-glass wine list that is not dominated by blunt dumb new world wines- very sophisticated and on point. In addition to the addictive Eggs McBlackCat, Sunday brunch features an excellent psyhe-folk-krautrock DJ set by the one and only Greh Holger (of Vacation Records fame)	1
I had a great maiden voyage with Canter's. I went to Langer's a couple years ago when I heard about the great Jewish deli tradition in LA and was pleased, so I decided to make it a point to try the equally important historical delis in the area.The decor and vibe is as cool as it gets. Old school NY deli vibe, but with a diner flare that only the west coast can provide (since we have more physical space). It's important to note that this old school vibe is not tacky, nor is it like walking into a dusty mausoleum. The place is not old, rather, it is classic, meaning they have faithfully preserved the fundamental character of the place, while still maintaining a modern restaurant.Food: The pickles are spot on. Crisp with just the right amount of spice. I had the Brooklyn ave. w/ corned beef and potato salad, while my guest had a pastrami Reuben w/ fries. My sandwich hit all the right notes---corned beef, slaw, Russian dressing, Jewish rye. I had a couple bites of the Reuben and was equally as pleased. The potato salad has an interesting sweet side to it that contrasts really well with the smoke of the meat and bite of the dressing and pickles. The only thing I am sad about, is not being able to take advantage of the bakery. There are some amazing looking things in that cabinet.	1
Lucky enough to attend a Yelp event here last evening and had an opportunity to sample some of the best items here: <br><br>Kegged cocktails - I had the Dark &amp; Stormy and Gin Fizz. Both were strong &amp; tasty. <br><br>Burger - Incredible. They use grass-fed beef and it was obviously fresh and quite juicy. I was wow&#39;ed by this one. Try this. <br><br>Wings, wonton, risotto ball appetizers - all worthy of ordering<br><br>The service was great all night, and everyone I encountered was professional. Really hoping this place does well going forward.	1
Brio has two locations in  Las Vegas. We have eaten at both, but this review pertains to Tivoli Village location. The ambiance is very lively and people are eating outdoors, indoor at tables and in the bar area. The tempo is upbeat and the noise level is contagious. The food was very good and one out-of-town guest praised it several times during dinner and later in an email. Our service was very good from most everyone, but our server was having a slightly off night... her focus seemed somewhere else but it was still good and not troublesome. Prices are reasonable... $70 for two including two glasses of wine, cappuccino, tax and tip.We enjoy Brio and other off-Strip restaurants in Las Vegas and frequent them more than the overpriced casino/hotel restaurants.Brio at Town Square and Tivoli Village are with the visit and recommended.	1
Wow on so many levels. Came in end of the night on a Thursday. Two cool dudes were working and took car of me and a friend. Very nice and helpful and gave us some SAKI to go with our late night snack. They made us a order of the pan seared and steamed dumplings and they were delicious. Had a unique green chili oil dipping sauce that paired nicely with the sweet flavorful ponzu dipping sauce. Great food even better service.	1
I was very lucky to find this place. Amazing subs and great salads. The Rotisserie chicken and the Roasted Turkey is excellent, both are cooked in house, so pretty much guaranteed fresh. I went three times in the first week of them opening. The salads aren&#39;t as good as the sandwiches but definitely still great. It wasn&#39;t expensive and was very clean. Definitely a staple for anyone living in the area! Excellent franchise with a lot of potential. <br><br>The employees who were working were also extremely helpful and willing to answer any questions I had! Overall excellent experience every time I have gone.	1
My dad use to bring us food from Thai Deli when I was in high school (long ago), always the #1 with double macaroni salad. I went recently and it still taste so good!	1
The first thing I spied when walking in was a predator. A baby one. Like in the movie only wrought from metal sitting on an end table by the door. The second thing that caught my eye was the shuffleboard table. I felt so much at home that I was trying to figure out where to put my bed. And I hadn\u2019t even made it to a table or looked at the menu yet.	1
I don&#39;t know about this place. I went once and I think I thought it was good, but went back again and maybe I just outgrew it. The banana cream pie is the best part. The fries with ketchup were good. The burger though was just blah, the sauce wasn&#39;t anything special and the meat wasn&#39;t either.	0
Great place! Food was wonderful, service was top notch!	0
The reviewer who wrote that &#34;Lazeez and its literally home-cooked meals are absolutely the best I have had, not just in Miami&#34; really needs to get out more. Either that, or things have dramatically changed at Lazeez in the 18 months since then.<br><br>I tried their meat samosas, lamb korma, and chicken tikka with naan on a recent visit. The samosas and the naan weren&#39;t bad, and they were the best part of the meal (note that the samosas are very small, only about a quarter the size of the typical samosa you would be served at most places). The other dishes were just fair, certainly not worth a drive across town.<br><br>The prices were a lot lower than what you would find at most South Asian restaurants in South Florida, but I&#39;d much rather pay higher prices and get some food that tastes good.<br><br>The man who took my order and later brought out my food seemed very brusque when he brought out the order, but it&#39;s hard to know what to make of that after only one visit to the restaurant.<br><br>One plus is that there is a Pakistani grocery store just a few steps away.	0
I've been eating and drinking at Glass Nickel for many years. The waitstaff is wonderful, the food is delicious and the drinks are strong. These days we order delivery about once a week and are never disappointed. Our order is always received in a much faster time than we expect!	0
My husband and I had a really good experience at Crush. We ordered the date &amp; artichoke pizza and a kale/mushroom salad for starters. The pizza was different and tasty (I can&#39;t remember ever seeing a date on a pizza before) and my husband, who is vegetarian, could not get enough of the salad. Also my husband was SO EXCITED because they carried Innis &amp; Gunn beer and he hadn&#39;t seen it in the States before. I had a glass of Chard. I thought it was pretty terrible but I&#39;m not one to complain about wines so I sipped it twice before my husband asked me if I liked it. I told him I didn&#39;t so he tried it. He thought it had gone bad so he asked the waitress to replace it with a different one. She was very kind about it and the new glass was quite nice. For entree I had the shrimp risotto and my husband had the roasted cauliflower. Both were great. We ended the meal with an odd sort of chocolate dessert with mangoes. It wasn&#39;t my favorite dessert ever but small enough that we still managed to finish it off easily. The waitress was great and attentive. It had a very European feel inside. You quickly forget that you are just inside a casino!	1
Interesting menu and were able to accommodate my gluten allergy with no problem.  Service was very good and waitress seemed to have many tables to cover.  Salmon was very good as were the grilled brussel sprouts and nice fresh salad.  Only real complaint was the valet parking service was very poor.  Waited out front in the area marked for valet for almost 00 minutes without a valet attendant ever coming out so we had to drive around and find street parking.	0
Terrible terrible attitude the lady over the phone sounded annoyed whenever I would ask her a question Mind you I ordered over the phone . Also took an hour to get delivered and I&#39;m less then a mile away . What is going on ?!	0
Yesterday was my second time trying this place. The first time I remember the food being SO great! Yesterday however I did not have the same experience. I feel like this place was too busy for its own good. The waiter who served us was a really attractive, kind guy, but.. He had so many tables spread out that we only saw him about three times. I ordered some french toast coffee cake style and a side of breakfast potatoes. When they arrived the potatoes were really over cooked (half of them so hard I couldn&#39;t eat them. My french toast was NOT the one I ordered. It took me about 5 minutes to get the waiters attention, he recognized the order was incorrect and then returns about 1 minute later WITH THE SAME FRENCH TOAST the only difference was at this point they threw on top the mix for the coffee cake french toast. :-( so with all the time those particular toast sat out they were cold. I was so disappointed with my meal. Even the french toast wasn&#39;t cooked all the way through. By cutting into it I found that only the top and bottom had a slight egg batter over them. The middle was regular uncooked bread. UGH! I don&#39;t think I would go back to them again.	0
great food and setting and staff. nice mix of drinks	1
I&#39;m not sure how this place got a 4star rating all around. Like other reviews here, i came because of rating but not worth it. To be honest, i like the ambiance here but not the food. Salsa tasted like some chili pepper, water and manufactured sauce taste. In other words MSG added sauces. Burrito had small portion of meat. Tostada salad bowl was greasy because they didnt fry at proper temperature. Tortilla bowl ate up all the oil from the fryer. It was greasy salad. Carne asada fries were okay. It was same salsa they had. I expected something better. I had to finish everything because i was starving. One funny thing was that the server came out with a pen and asked me if i left a pen at their restaurant. I dont think i eat with a pen and theres no reason why i shouldve used one. And after i told him it wasnt mine he said the owner asked me to write a review on yelp about my experience. So here you go. From what i saw, the owner left before my table left. I wouldnt recommend here to any of my friends.	0
I went here for brunch on a Saturday and it was pretty empty around 11:30am, but overall I really liked the place. The portions were enormous; I had some sort of pancake breakfast with eggs, toast, bacon, and potatoes- all very good. My wife had the fish tacos which she enjoyed. An added touch was that they brought out a bowl of cereal as an appetizer, too funny.	1
&#34;GOODBYE SEX. HELLO BURGERS AND FRIES FROM THE APPLE PAN!!&#34; <br><br>I heard some freak announce that upon exiting this fine dining establishment not too long ago.<br><br>Hmm...perhaps it was me...<br><br>One of the guys who works here kinda looks like Charles Bukowski, and I&#39;m sure if good &#39;ol Hank were still around, he&#39;d hit up this joint for sure.	1
Dishes tried (partly from Restaurant Week Menu + standard menu)	1
*This review is not about the food, but rather the service*<br><br>Though Barboncino doesn&#39;t take reservations, I called yesterday to ensure that they could accommodate our party, as one of my girlfriends recently broke her hip. The host I spoke to was incredibly accommodating -- ensuring me that the dinner staff would be made aware of our situation and to call 30 minutes before arrival to ensure we were seated immediately.<br><br>However, when we called the restaurant that evening, the dinner hostess could not have been ruder. She was unwilling to accommodate our party, and refused to acknowledge the conversation I had with the brunch host.<br><br>Needless to say, we were completely put off by the service and will not be returning.	0
Chose this restaurant based on the recommendation of a friend. The food was excellent, but the service left much to be desired. After our food was served our waiter never checked back in at the table so by the time I had a chance to tell him that I had not received a part of my dinner it was too late. We also had to make some simple requests multiple times.I found it strange that the amuse bouche at a seafood restaurant contained beef... I think that would be more appropriate at a steakhouse. Since I don't eat beef, I have no ideas whether it was good or not :)That said, entrees, soup and appetizer were all amazing! If they improved their service, this would be an amazing place for dinner.	1
I wanted to like this place, but was fairly disappointed.We ordered for delivery and were told on the phone that it would take about an hour, which is fine. But the food showed up after 90 minutes, not an hour. When I called the restaurant to inquire about the status of our order, I was treated politely but offered no apology for the lateness.The driver wasn't carrying any change when he got to the door, and since he (for some odd reason) didn't park in front of our building, I had to wait while he ran down the block to his car to get change. He also offered no apology for the long wait.The food was just so-so. One member of our group ordered the pork rice plate and two of us ordered vegetarian dishes. Nothing was bad, just rather humdrum and unimaginative.	0
HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT and very great Chinese food!<br>I order the &#39;fish head&#39; or something, it was DELICIOUS but HOT! Home style of meat is the best &#39;smoked meat&#39; or looked like &#39;bacon&#39; but not real &#39;bacon&#39; I ever had. Steam egg also is the one I highly recommend. <br><br>The location is kinda hard to find out, cross street Chinatown and behind or next Korean Queen yogurt (sorry! my friend take me there).	1
Toast, is a mediocre place, with a high tagged reputation. It&#39;s a few notches about Denny&#39;s, and a few notches below Dough Boys (who is currently getting rid of termite infestation).<br><br>The only thing I like about this place, is the smoked salmon platter, and the salade nicoise (although a heap of canned tuna in the middle of this salad, is a bit ridiculous (why not fresh tuna?). Oh yes, they have stevia available too, for my iced tea (even if the last time I went, the waitress didn&#39;t even know what it was). <br><br>The service is actually pretty decent, and I&#39;ve only eaten on the sidewalk. I actually have no idea what the interior looks like. I definitely don&#39;t go for the crowd. I could care less who frequents an establishment. <br><br>The food comes out relatively quick, but it&#39;s nothing spectacular. Everything they have here, can be found better elsewhere. I guess the only reason I go, is because of the smoked salmon. I really love bagels, capers, cream cheese, and smoked salmon. Otherwise, I&#39;d never actually go back. I&#39;m sure their overhead $$$ is ridiculous, so their prices reflect that. Also, parking is pretty much a hit or miss. You either get a spot, or you don&#39;t. The valet here is inconsistent, and street parking here is rare. Don&#39;t even PONDER parking in the neighborhoods. You WILL get a ticket. Just be observative of the posted street signs.	0
TINY place, limited parking. The dining area is basically the kitchen<br><br>but that doesn&#39;t even matter because after that first bite, all else fades into black.<br><br>This place really has some of the best tasting Korean comfort foods around. If you&#39;re debating whether to get chicken soup (sam-gae-tang) or abalone porridge (junbok-jook) GET BOTH!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Based on the food alone I would not say this restaurant is great! It is good certainly but for the price you pay I would expect better.<br><br>The service was not what I would have expected but the restaurant itself is appealing.<br><br>I went there twice with groups for my office and each time we were underwhelmed.<br><br>We got the pizza(spinach) it was nice but dry <br>The crab toast which was expensive for what it was <br>Mashed potatoes were good but general feeling was that we had better.<br>I did get a pasta special which I enjoyed though so overall that did save the meal.<br><br>Long story short- between the staff and the food it was not worth $140 a head.	0
Side dishes are almost non existent!!! Kimchi and duk bok Ki!!! No salad instead only onions!!! My group was told we wouldn't be able to order unless all the meat was consumed beforehand ... 2hr time limit ??? WTH ?!	0
Great food and a really nice place. I tried a steak with mushrooms and potatoes and I liked it a lot :) Will try something else one of these days :)<br>Also, hookah is pretty affordable and if you are there, try their home flavour.<br><br>You&#39;ll see me again very soon! :)	1
Great pizza amongst the multitude of pizza places Johnnys the best! Margarita extra basil add pepperoni well done yummy good job guys!	1
We were so glad to see a sushi restaurant in downtown Las Vegas. The atmosphere was very pleasing. However, the service did not match. It took us about 15 minutes to receive our first dish (a few pieces of nigiri sushi). After receiving many dishes, such as the yellowtail yuzu ceviche and screaming orgasm, we thought to ourselves &#34;what was our favorite dish?&#34; and we couldn&#39;t think of it. This place has potential, but the server did not know much about the product she was selling. This place needs some help if it is going to survive. Le Thai will definitely be funding this to stay open for the next year (since it apparently is the same owners).	0
The service is poor. Waiting more that 15 min only to order something to drink. I can&#39;t say anything about the food because I leave the restaurant before order something. Pretty bad, because the menu looks delicious	0
This is a no fuss place. It&#39;s a hidden gem of a place. It&#39;s a counter nestled in the rear of a market. If you&#39;re looking for a high end frill filled place; go somewhere else. If you&#39;re looking to have a good sandwich and a laid back experience come on by, but don&#39;t tell all your friends just the cool ones.<br>Erica makes top notch sandwiches!<br>Personally I didn&#39;t like the fries but the potato salad made up for that and that nah have been top 3 chicken sandwiches I&#39;d ever had.	1
Entrees so devine<br>Your patio is Paris<br>Models everywhere	1
We went here on Valentine's Day and we had a great time.  The atmosphere was very nice and romantic. On the bar side of the restaraunts they have a lounge area with a fireplace and a television. The food that we ordered was pretty on point and I would definitely recommend trying this place out.  Our waiter wasn't great but all of the other employees made up for him.	0
Mediocre at best. While the service was phenomenal the food really just wasn&#39;t that great, especially for the price. Tough calamari, dried out chicken. There is far better Italian food in NYC so I would advise you keep looking to avoid disappointment.	0
I went in not having much of any expectation and I was pleasantly surprised. Their burger was awesome and we had a great dinner.The prices were affordable. My friend ordered the tuna appetizer and he said it was pretty amazing. I will be back.	1
The first and only time I visited this celebrity bakery, I was waiting for my 2 loaves of bread, a batard, a couple of baguettes and an olive bread. What shocked me as I looked at their display case, is how much people are willing to spend for a small container of calabatta olives. Away from the glitz of the bakery, came the taste test. Having lived in France, I had memories waiting to be rekindled. But alas, memories are not meant to be rekindled. Just not at this place.The crust was as hard as coconut shell. While it is true that the crumb had those irregular large holes, the hallowed signs of a well rested European loaf, the tooth shattering texture of the crust creates an everlasting imprint in the psyche. Could this be Crust Shock?I wondered just how long those loaves had been left around. And to this day, it still manages to keep me awake (sometimes).Later, after eating bread from ACME and Semifreddis, I became and am still convinced that the bread basket of West is definitely the Bay area.	0
I&#39;ve given a two star rating because of my last visit to AR. It seemed like they were purposely sending out the most horrible and cold food they possibly could. Sad part is that I have had a delivery from this place and it was pretty good. I took 3 friends to eat here and I looked like a moron for picking this place. Even the tater tots and soup was cold. How is that possible?	0
In a city full of gourmet burger places, this has been one of my favorite so far. Too many places charge over $10 for a small burger that doesn't even come with fries. I've been here a few times and have almost exclusively ordered the p dub burger with bacon, but it's probably the best burger I've had in Los Angeles. The sriracha mayo is what really sets it off and it comes in at a decent size for about $8 ($9 with bacon). No fries, but I can live with that. There is only outdoor seating, which is kind of annoying. Other than that I would probably rate it 4.5 stars or so.	1
Meh. Describes it completely. My friends adore this place but even with a massive menu... The dish I selected was nothing to rave about. I got the breakfast dish with links and eggs with toast. The service was slow... and my food didn't make it up for that. My links were a little rubbery and eggs ( i got egg whites) were buttery and saturated with fat or something. I tried to eat a little healthy with the eggs but they made it fattening and it didn't taste good. I had 10 times better experience at Dennys. The reason I actually didn't give it one star coz my friends love it and it's not like I will not go here again because frankly they love it here. however, they ran out of matzo ball soup. A jewish deli ran out of the best dish... And this was the second time. And then lo and behold two minutes later we saw another waiter bringing soup to the other table. Our waitress said Oh, I guess we did but shouldn't have anymore. Wow. I mean it's pretty bad for me... but I will give it a second chance. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish.... But avoid the breakfast food!	0
My boyfriend and I needed a nice romantic night out with just the two us since our schedules have been hectic lately. I chose Luna Park because other Yelpers gave high remarks and the menu looked appetizing.<br><br>Needless to say, we weren&#39;t disappointed at all. I made reservations on <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&amp;s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">opentable.com</a> the same day and when we got to the restaurant we were seated within five minutes. At first the hostess was going to place us at a two-seater table, but I asked if we could be placed in a booth and she accomodated our request.<br><br>We started off with the goat cheese fondue with apples and grilled bread. All I can say is yum, yum and yum! It was a nice appetizer portion for us to share without making us full. I would have never thought to pair granny smith apples with goat cheese, but it works!<br>For our entrees, I got the Onglet Steak with Chile Verde Sauce and instead of fries, I got mashed potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the Breaded Pork Cutlet with mashed potatoes. My steak was cooked perfectly, medium-rare and tasted delicious. My boyfriend&#39;s Cutlet was yummy and paired perfectly with the apple-cranberry sauce.<br><br>To drink, I ordered their White Sangria..Very tasty without overpowering with alcohol or sweetness.<br><br>Service was excellent. Food was delicious. Ambience perfect. A very enjoyable dining experience. I would definitely dine here again!<br><br>We finished off our dining experience in L.A. with dessert at Mashti Malones!	1
I was working at a restaurant on North Bay Village and I was looking for a healthy/vegan alternative. After looking at the reviews, I took a trip to the website and I must say it&#39;s amazing!<br><br>All of the menu choices looked delicious! They do have a $30 delivery minimum (which I was happy to oblige, I was desperately hungry). <br><br>I ordered the hummus and pita bread (comes whole wheat), black bean soup, veggie wrap with tofu, and a quinoa veggie salad. The person who answered was very happy and made my order a breeze.<br><br>Everything came in about an hour (rush hour traffic) and it was absolutely lovely. I will be telling everyone about it and definitely ordering from here again.	1
really, really good :)	1
If this place wasn't on the lake/channel it would be out of business.  Crap food, blah service. Avoid. Nice outside deck. That is why it gets a star.	0
As promising as it seemed, this bar was a tremendous disappointment. Upon ordering, another bartender asked what we wanted and we said that we just ordered vodka tonics. When the bartender brought is our drinks, another brought us the same. He accused me of &#34;never ordering a drink before&#34; and literally grabbed my drink from my hand and dumped it. Meanwhile, I was charged AND TIPPED the other bartender. When I asked the other bartender about my drink, he purposefully ignored me. Only when I went to a sever to explain did the situation get better. Never before have I been SO insulted by a business.	0
The patio of this somewhat hidden restaurant directly next to the 99 cent store on sunset is really pretty, and is a nice comfortable place to have a meal.The food is sometimes really good, and sometimes just okay, you usually can't go wrong with the filet mignon with blue cheese sauce and an order of the frites with the roqueforte dipping sauce. decadent and tasty. the pannacotta for dessert is a nice finish.$40-60 per person	1
Went here with my mom today and had half original crispy chicken, half sweet and spicy chicken. The chicken was decent, but fried a little too long. The salad that came along with it had thousand islands dressing on it, which wasnt great, but hey- at least there was salad^^The bathrooms are pretty gross, ad water comes out only if you turn the left handle of the faucet. The service is good, but it took a long time for the chicken to come out. The interior is cozyish. Don't know if I would come again...	1
My husband and I went to Canter's for the 1st and last time last night and we weren't too happy. They didn't have the desserts the menu offered. We settled for something else but dessert wasn't great. The floors were disgusting. Seems like they never cleaned. If it's not clean on the outside don't want to think about how filthy it must be in the inside.	0
Sssslllloooowwww....	0
5 stars - nightlife3.5 stars - brunch/ lunchI came here 2x in 12 hours! So I'll break up my review into 2 halves.NIGHTLIFE:When I first drove by, I saw a massive line at 10:30pm (or so), and I started freaking out. According to our Korea study abroad reunion plans, we weren't planning on going in until 11:30 or 12ish. Luckily, one of my friends knew the owner/ was a regular patron, so we were able to skip the entire line (with a group of 12, no less!).As this was my first time, I had no idea what to expect. We went up the elevator to a small room, then into another elevator which actually led to perch, and then started taking it all in. It was hard to tell what was exactly going on in the dim lighting, but it seemed like a pretty poppin place. We headed out to the patio area. It was a bit chilly that night (so ladies, def bring a jacket. There's no coat check, but it's worth keeping warm). Drinks are pretty decently priced. Maybe it's cuz I've only been clubbing a lot in DTLA, but I was pleasantly surprised when drinks were like $10 (i.e. 1 Macallan 12, 1 vodka soda with a splash of cranberry, and a beer = $30). This isn't really a dancing spot, more bar/ loungey - lots of people talking and drunkenly making out in the corners haha Regardless pretty cool place. The view is great, venue is classy, a great place to go out!Last call was at 1:40am. This might've been my only point of irritation. Too early.~~~~~BRUNCH/ LUNCH:Luckily, my friend's AirBnB was literally just across the street from Perch, so we eventually got up with a hangover and decided to go to Perch for food (just 2 of us by this point). This was on a Sunday morning/noon.It looks really good in the daylight. Almost everything that was a wall with windows was now open, so there was so much air and natural light flooding into the place. We got pretty lucky and got a seat right away (if you have a bigger party, def get ready to wait). We sat "inside" but it was right next to an open door/window, so it was basically like sitting outside but in the shade! Here's what we ordered:- bloody mary: it's pretty big, didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it, but it was still pretty good (not spicy though)- mon petit cheri: my broken French translates this into "my little friend" and it comes in a little glass bursting with so many flavors. It's really an interesting drink. There's goose cherry noir, creme yvette, ginger, champagne - I don't even know what those first 2 ingredients are. Not sure if I'd recommend unless you want to try something completely random. It gets stronger as you get to the bottom. - perch burger: to be quite honest, this was like a gourmet IN-N-OUT burger in terms of seasoning and dressing but with a fried egg on it. It was a really messy burger but obviously tasted pretty good. Got it cooked medium rare with a side of fries (you can choose salad if you want). The fries are regular (not sure if you can upgrade to the truffle ones). - #13 benedict: your standard eggs benedict (they have other options as well with salmon or crab). These were ok although they were a bit salty for my taste. These came with a side of house potatoes. Overall, while the service was good, the food tasted ok. It wasn't bad but it wasn't really stunning. If anything, you're paying for the ambience and the view, which are awesome.	1
The food here is very good! We have been back three times this week. Mmmm. Get an omelet and a doughnut!	1
Reservations for 1:15 and seated 20 minutes later. Took 45 minutes to get a glass of water and some menus. Overall experience: Shitty service, poor staff communication, and unapologetic. Fuck this place. Waste of time and money. This place needs a staff that compliments the menu. That shit isn't working in harmony.	0
Very nice, clean place. Excellent service and great food. Will be back again with more friends.	1
Terrible. First time eating Cuban food and went over the specials with the server. Asked for one item and received something else that was almost double the price. I didn&#39;t know what I was eating so I didn&#39;t send it back. Also charged me a different price than what&#39;s on the menu for domestic beer. Server would not correct any of the charges until I asked to speak with the manager. First Cuban experience... worst Cuban experience.	0
The best burger I've ever had. The onion rings are also fantastic. Love it here.	1
Another Madison favorite.	1
Plates too tiny and not so many choices <br>Don&#39;t go there if you&#39;re hungry ! Disappointment for us..	0
I came here because of the yelp reviews. <br>I had ordered the burger and pulled pork. <br>The pulled pork had way too much sauce on it. <br>The burger was average but a lot better than the pulled pork.	0
I had dinner with a girlfriend the waiter was so rude! he was pushing us to get alcohol! when I mention I want water...he was very upset....Not going back ever again	0
I love this place for three reasons:<br>It&#39;s totally gluten free which is great for my celiac family members<br>The food is delicious and plentiful <br>The place is a classic intimate east village restaurant. Very classy and zero pretentiousness. <br>The only draw back is that it is BYOB <br><br>Even without the gluten free thing I would recommend it highly.	1
My wife and I just happened to be in the Little Havana area and we searched Yelp for a close restaurant and found our way here. First off we just moved from Los Angeles and we have had years and years worth of good Mexican food. However we have never had El Salvadorian food so we were kind of excited to try it. The place is fairly small and its in a little strip mall so be warned there are only 15 or so parking spots which were all full so we circled the block a couple times to find parking. <br><br>Once seated we were given menus that had tons of dishes to choose from all with pictures which is always a plus. My wife ordered a Carne Asada plate and I ordered the Caldo De Rez and we both really loved our meals. The Carne Asada was served fresh off the grill with steaming rice. The steak was huge and my wife couldn&#39;t finish it and my BIG bowl of Caldo was as good as any I&#39;ve ever had. The beef was perfectly tender and not rubbery as you will get from time to time. Overall our first experience was absolutely perfect.<br><br>Before we left we decided to order some chicken tamale&#39;s to take home since we&#39;ve never had El Salvadorian tamale&#39;s. Now this was the game changer, the next morning we ate the tamale&#39;s and they were just incredible and by far the best we&#39;ve ever had. They were very moist and not all dry and they were just stuffed with chicken and bursting with flavor. They were so good that we went back a few days later and ordered 30 more and took them to a party at the park where they went quick. Having lived in Los Angeles our entire lives we&#39;ve eaten a million tamale&#39;s but these were hands down the best we&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>I might add the place is not expensive at all.	1
I called ahead for a reservation for a friend and I. The person I spoke to on the phone recommended making reservations, and they had openings a few hours out. I made a reservation, left my name and number, and we showed up promptly.<br><br>After checking in, we noticed the host had already crossed our name off. Either someone already checked in or they marked us off, even though we showed up on time. He did try and hide the fact that he screwed up, by highlighting through my name again. He told me the wait would be about 20 minutes. After we showed up on time for our reservations. He didn&#39;t admit a mistake or anything, just told us to have a drink at their bar. We sit down at the bar, no one is behind the bar, so we aren&#39;t offered water or an alcohol menu or anything. At least give us a cup of water if you messed up.<br><br>About 10 minutes later, a loud Asian lady starting screaming at us to follow her and guides us to a table. She then starts yelling at everyone being seated that we need to sit shoulder to shoulder to each other since they are fitting two more people than the table normally holds. This indicated to me that they did give our reservation away to someone else and trying to shoehorn everyone into a cramped space was the last straw.<br><br>Me and my friend got up and told her that she could stop screaming at us, because there would be plenty of space with us gone. We ended up going to Ohjah, which had excellent service, great food, without having to deal with a host screw up and an old Asian lady screaming at us.	0
Food AMAZING ! Service AMAZING ! Good restudent ... The nicest foood .....good service and great setting	1
We came here on Father&#39;s Day for brunch. I left feeling like I picked a great place to take my dad. <br><br>The restaurant has a clean, modern decor inside and the outdoor seating feels like a secluded garden. The views are beautiful. For a city with so much water and scenery, there certainly is a shortage of good restaurants with a great view. <br><br>I can&#39;t speak for dinner, but their brunch was pretty good and they have a $15 bottomless mimosa/bloody mary special. They have an a la carte brunch or a buffet for $27 with a spread of eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, fruit, pastries, etc. I thought the a la carte items that my mom and dad ordered tasted better than my brunch, but I definitely got more for my money and after a few mimosas, the quality didn&#39;t matter as much. It was good, but it was your basic 3 or 4 star hotel quality breakfast buffet. I was mostly enjoying my morning beverage and the view. <br><br>I&#39;d definitely come back for drinks and appetizers or dessert. This place really seems perfect for that, and would probably be a great date night spot. Service was a bit slow, but very friendly and we weren&#39;t in a rush. <br><br>Look for parking nearby and walk over to the Viceroy. The parking was around $12 and they don&#39;t validate or do a discount if you eat there.	1
This is the best shawarma in Los Angeles - HANDS DOWN! Their quality has gone down recently but its still pretty good!	1
Banzo falafel is good - no - excellent. Really freaking good. I am happy they exist and deliver. The tabouli was weird - like eating a mint plant. But back to the falafel, so good.	0
First time at this location. Super intimate good for dates. Great food- the fried plantains were amazing. Good cocktails.	1
yum yum yum!!! food was great, service was great!!!	1
I just went on my first ever visit to the Diamond Knot Brewery today. Been thinking about going here for a long time and I finally did it. I have had their beer at brewfest and pubs in Seattle. 	1
So it&#39;s Korean and it&#39;s barbecue but this isn&#39;t your usual Korean bbq. Small&#39;s does a bit of a twist on classic american bbq with a Korean flare. This is most evident in the sauces, sides and specials. I personally really appreciated their take on bibimbap. The brisket and pulled pork were solid and I am looking forward to going back to try the cooked to order chicken. Only complaint was the portion sizes for the platters. They could really use to double the meat for the price.	1
The food is great! Really busy, fun atmosphere. Had the Dojo burger with a fried egg, the ginger slaw is great. Only downside is the sewage smell when dining outside on the street as I don't think there is indoor seating.	1
The best part of this meal was the Andes mint on the way out. Was so excited for this place to be great and it was just awful.<br><br>What a beautiful restaurant space. I took a peek in the kitchen and it looked amazing too, with a smoker and everything. Upstairs the gf and I got a table for two and sat down near the corner.<br><br>Cue the fifteen f*cking minutes until someone noticed us, which only happened after I started staring at a group of four servers talking amongst themselves. Our server came over and said there was a section switch or something that explains how we were forgotten. Meanwhile, we&#39;re extremely thirsty and watched the table behind us get seated after us, get waters and put an order in before we are even paid attention to.<br>So - strike one - the service is crap. On to the food!<br><br>Did we order the wrong things? We didn&#39;t go crazy and get frog legs or shrimp beignets...got two sandwiches (the Brisket Dip which according to our server is the best sandwich) and the Lobster RollBoy or whatever it was called. Side of Gumbo Fried Rice. Fried rice was pretty bland, we were hungry enough to eat it all though. Brisket dip was the best of the three, but not enough au jus in a ramekin too small to actually dip the sandwich in it kind of defeated the purpose of having it there in the first place and ruined it for me. The lobster roll was bland as hell and for $18 was a total rip off. In fact, all the food was priced at the same price points as small plate gourmet restaurants like Son of a Gun and the food here is NOT anywhere close to that good. Overpriced, bland food... On to the drinks!<br><br>We each got martinis. They were made well and I enjoyed them. Yay. We got two little daiquiri glasses to bring to the bar downstairs to get a little drink on the way out. Classy. Cute. Very nice. However the bartender downstairs looked all like &#34;UGH how can I be troubled to pour what is basically an icee into a little glass instead of making drinks for customers who are paying for theirs and are actually going to tip me&#34; when I did tip her, just after we had our drinks.<br><br>This place is crap and if it were cheaper - it wouldn&#39;t be such a big deal that it sucks. Definitely avoid, or just come here for drinks. Hope they get better.	0
So many things went wrong that I&#39;ll just begin in chronological order.<br><br>1. Hot water for my chamomile tea was lukewarm. The tagless tea bag was brought to me with someone&#39;s bare hands.<br>2. The tables were sticky, there weren&#39;t enough place settings and I had to ask for food menus (keep in mind, I made a reservation and even arrived early...there was no reason for our table to not be set up properly).<br>3. In the group of 7, only 2 people enjoyed their meals (potato croquettes &amp; chicken n waffles). My order of two eggs (over-easy) with bacon &amp; homefries were terrible. The eggs were cooked over-hard, the bacon was simultaneously raw and charred and the homefries were the color of cardboard. <br>4. The fritatta of the day was so tiny and came with the same weird potatoes. <br>5. We had to ask for butter when 5 people had toast with their meals. They brought us one spindle of butter to share.<br>6. My father-in-law&#39;s chair slipped from beneath him and he fell on the floor (b/c the chairs were wobbly and the floor was dirty). The staff didn&#39;t try to do anything to compensate for this.<br>7. The staff didn&#39;t refill our water glasses.<br><br>This was just the worst place.	0
Dinner at Ugly Kitchen was mediocre.<br><br>Two friends and I came and were squished into a tiny table even though we had a reservation. The table was so tiny that we could hardly fit two entrees on it at the same time.<br><br>The drinks were the best part of the meal - we made it in time for happy hour and their spicy mango drink was yummy.<br><br>But really, the food was so &#34;meh.&#34;<br><br>The dumplings tasted like pizza. The brie/apple bruschetta was more of a dessert than an appetizer. The chicken adobo was extremely salty and the pork belly entree was 3/4ths fat (I know that pork belly has a lot of fat on it but this dish hardly had any meat). I was definitely disappointed. <br><br>Would come back for drinks but not for food.	0
Visited the new location this morning and had the raw oatmeal and coffee. Coffee is from Panther - enough said on that. Oatmeal was creamy with a nutty flavor and just the right amount of spices. It was served with fresh berries and shaved coconut - yum. The location is larger and has a better layout.	1
man I wanted to love this place since its so close to home, but then again it's probably for the best (i would be getting ramen way too often!) a little background on ramen places I love in order of top favorite first: shinsengumi, santouka, robata jinya, daikokuya. My usual order is spicy miso. I will say the broth is a thick buttery and complex so plus on that but was a little on the salty side. The noodles were thick and a bit too chewy for me, the chashu was soft but had this smoky flavor that didnt balance out well with the broth and is in this huge circular shape that to me was overwhelming. didn't finish the chashu. or my bowl.I don't like giving "ok" reviews :( but i felt like it should be done because I was really looking forward to it because of all the great reviews. Also a little bit pricey, itcame out to $11.40. but it is very new and hopefully management takes these reviews in a constructive way i'd like to try this place again in the future.	0
This place definitely has THE freshest ingredients on their pizza that I have ever been to. Although the pizza tastes fresh and the place is not touristy at all, I would not recommend it for families because it seems to be more of a pizza joint for the younger crowd. It is very expensive for personal size pizzas (but one has to account for the quality of the pizzas).	0
Just hellllllll yeah!!!	0
I splurge at 51 Lincoln five or six times a year because it's the perfect splurge - pretty much guaranteed to be a great dining experience in every respect.  This was a Valentine's evening special, in the early stages of a February blizzard, and the ambiance was warm and inviting, the food as spectacular as ever, and the service highly professional without being the least bit stuffy.As long as this restaurant is open, I'll be eating there.	1
Ordered take out and was ready in 15 minutes. I couldn&#39;t wait to taste all the goodness I ordered. I have to say the mac and cheese is a must! I also ordered the dolphin and the miami vice both were amazing and the icing to the cake where the pieces of candy.	1
Terrific ambience makes for a great spot for any occasion. Food is also excellent - warm pretzel bread, shrimp pasta, braised short rib were standouts.Service however is spotty.  While attentive one minute, the next they disappear.  For the last half of our meal not a soul came to check on us or refill water.  Restaurant was not overly crowded.Still a good dining experience.  Four stars.	1
This place rocks! Great food, good vibes, drinks, & awesome inventive food! This amazing new place is a must stop!	1
Fancy French fantastic rooftop. You feel transported to another city, if not another time.Nifty decor and potentially original tile-work. A little hard to navigate your way to the damn restaurant and bar. I didn't eat here, but I did drink. It's a little snooty in tone, but I think that's why people come here. "If you're not paying $12 a drink it must not be good." is the attitude. I guess that's part of why they pump in the All-French pop music throughout the night.And while their "lemonade" was sweet and smooth, it didn't pack a punch and it wasn't so novel in the taste department either. The other mixology drinks didn't impress in their description, but I'm usually a straight up whiskey or dirty martini kind of guy. Now if they had some bacon infused whiskey, or homemade absinthe, or some unlikely mezcals maybe we could talk, but as it is, Perch has a DELIGHTFUL downtown balcony with amazing views, and that's the real reason to come here.	1
I've had gelato in a number of Italian cities. This bests most of them.	1
Full disclosure - I&#39;m a BIG fan of Dig Inn already, so when I found out that they had just opened a new location very close to my place of employment, I nearly flipped my lid. I love how easy Dig Inn makes it for me to eat relatively well, while still feeling like I&#39;m being indulgent by eating out. <br><br>The staff at this location is BEYOND FRIENDLY. I&#39;ve seen them regularly go out of their way to serve customers. <br><br>I also love that the refrigeration/food prep area downstairs is totally visible, so that the customer can see their fresh vegetables and other foods stored and prepared. It really drives home the fact that I&#39;m eating real, fresh food. <br><br>Love it! Will be back many more times, and am looking forward to when they finally get their wine/beer/kombucha taps going!	1
Brilliant sauce on baked oysters. Perfectly dressed salad with fresh lemon accent. Parsnip cake and sauce on snapper well done. Malted milk ice cream tastes just like the candy. Service is attentive but not overbearing. Great dinner.	0
Food: unapologetically rich. This could be good or bad depending on your tastes. I ordered the burger (honestly dear yelpers, I don&#39;t think you need an egg or the bacon in it, unless you want to bring yourself closer to a heart attack! It was already so rich in itself.) and the bacon on the side. The bacon I ordered because of yelp recommendations. I wish I didn&#39;t. It&#39;s bacon. The burger was good but hello, there was a strand of hair in it. Hurray. Not.<br><br>Service: good at first then terrible towards the end. We waited for the check for so long, I had to STAND UP and actually go to someone at the bar to ASK FOR OUR BILL. This was lunchtime on a Tuesday. I don&#39;t care if the restaurant was full. Service should still be good, especially for a place that is known for a 1 to 2 hour wait. Oh, maybe THIS is why there&#39;s a 2 hour wait.<br><br>Summary: good food but not worth the wait or the crappy service. Be sure to go work out before or after your meal.	0
Bratalian is our favorite! We go once a week and always look forward to eating there again, what more can i say?!!!	1
Bars range from $3 to $5. Good place to buy unique chocolate candy and bars. Perfect for gifts for those out of state.	1
Great Place and Vibe. Been here three times, once before a show, once for a sit down dinner, and once for drinks after work. Each time was a great experience. Being a Chef I am a fan of big, bold but simple flavors, I hate dishes that are overly complicated and take a paragraphs to describe. one maybe two exotic ingredient tops in each dish if any, please. RW delivers in the food Department with that criteria. Rich Smoky Meats. Twists on Classics, Fresh, bold and original combinations, making me say Hmm... why didn't think of that? and Oh... I am so Stealing this! The Service is always friendly and knowledgeable. Being in the Biz for over 25 years I can tell immediately if a place is squared away, and when the crew is genuinely having fun, and this is one of those places. I am also a HUGE fan of whiskeys, if there's one I see that I want, I'll usually order it before even thinking of the price. Se la vie. The gal who does the blending and infusing of the liquors does an excellent job. and comes up with what I call Real as opposed to Frou Frou Cocktails, they always lean towards the classics in the sense, i could see several being a regular drink of mine. They are most often reasonably priced when compared to super high-end whiskeys. not Cheap But indeed Fair. Overall A great and fun place to hang out with a bunch of character and soul. I love old Seattle Buildings. P.S. those bitching and moaning about no AC and it being Soooo Crowded, lighten up Butter Cup and learn a little patience, the world is really short on it these days.	1
Service was great but the sushi was very plain. Could use some special rolls on the menu as well.	0
This was my second time here.Not crowded. But the service here is ridiculous!My friend and I met up with 2 other people who were already here. We were sitting for about 15 mins and no one came up to us so my friend tried to get a waitress' attention but she ignored us. Another friend tried to get a waitress' attention but again we were ignored. So I raised my 2 arms up and waved it back and forth and yelled if we could get a menu so we could order. A lady rushed towards us. I had been sitting in the restaurant for about 40 mins with my tummy grumbling really loud! We finally received the ramen we each ordered but were never given napkins and chopsticks. Also at this point we found that the restaurant had a check in offer through Yelp of free daimaru or gyoza. So again we flagged for a waitress so we could order daimaru and ask for napkins and chopsticks.She came. With half of her attention to us and the other half trying to sit a group down we asked for the daimaru and then she immediately walked away. This didn't give us a chance to ask her for utensils so we just grabbed some from another table. I don't have a clue what was up with the people at Genki Ramen last Monday but I surely will not return here. The place was not busy at all and service was HORRIBLE!!! The first time I came here my waiter was very kind!! Very helpful and even took the time to describe to me what each appetizer was. But this second time was just horrible!!!	0
Big portions. With the price I paid, it served me approximately two meals.<br><br>Old-fashion breakfast. The menus of what they are serving for the day is listed on the chalkboard. Being not much of a meat eater, it was a disadvantage seeing so many dishes containing pork or beef. I did find a chicken dish --fried chicken and decided to give it a shot. My sister ordered her bacon and scrambled eggs. Our waiter was extremely attentive and did a lot to accommodate us. <br><br>According to my sister, bacon was extremely greasy and fatty. But I thought that is what bacon is really suppose to be. Scrambled egg was so bland she had to add in salt and pepper to even make it edible enough for her to eat. At least she like her toast since it was warm and delicious.<br><br>I had no complaints regarding food quality. But food quantity? Wowza. I was served with two big thigh pieces, a wing, and a drumstick. The fried chicken also came with sides of corn, mashed potatoes with gravy, coleslaw, and toast. I definitely do not dare to complain about being hungry after leaving the cafe since I was stuffed...like a chicken, ready to be fried up to be someone else&#39;s meal. lol	1
Hubby and I had a great dinner - lamb vindaloo was tender and at 3 stars just enough spice for me! The exterior does not look too appealing but the interior is nicely arranged and even with a big crowd the service is excellent.	1
Horrible service! Took the waitress forever to bring out a house salad and few appetizers. Food was whatever with not much taste. Took another decade to bring out a dessert.	0
I like the dated atmosphere, and the fact that they are open 24 hours. The last time I came here, it stunk like salted meat really bad from the entrance on. I can tolerate the smell of meat generally, but it didn't smell good. The food isn't amazing, but you have a decent amount of choices late at night, so it's not at all bad.	1
Was so excited for this from reading some reviews. Got food delivered, took a while but wasn&#39;t worried as I thought they&#39;re a popular place so wud be busy. Ordered chips n guacamole, pollo burrito, mexi sausage tacos, steak tacos and pollo tacos. Some of the blandest food I&#39;ve ever had, dry and no spice or flavour. The only saving grace was the mexi sausage taco, which was good I must say. The guacamole was overly bulked out with onion and tomato. The burrito was just plain bad. Good chips though.	0
This was the first place I went to when I first moved here a year ago, and have gone many times foolishly thinking it would just magically get better. Like when you have a crappy car, and you think "Hey, maybe if I just turn up the stereo and keep driving, I can just ignore the fact that my car is completely falling apart and on fire". It's like that. I keep going, thinking somehow it's just going to magically change. But it just magically gets worse.The straw that broke the camel's back, was when I went there in the early afternoon on a weekday. It took almost 40 minutes to get service to take our order. I ordered the mac and cheese with bacon. As we waited almost an additional 30 minutes, we looked around to see that there was one other table next to us, 2 firemen, and that's IT. In the WHOLE place.When I got my mac and cheese, it was in a small ramekin. I forked into it, to find watery butter and a bunch of bacon. I'm actually 85% sure there was NO CHEESE. IN THE MAC AND CHEESE. It was the most bland, awful, butter water soup i've ever had. for $8!!! What!I was so furious. I should have spoke up. I lay awake at night wondering why the hell I didn't speak up when I was forking over my money. I wondered why I ate that. I wondered why Firefly was cancelled so abruptly. Same with My So Called Life. Anyway...I'm breaking up with The Wood. It just doesn't satisfy me. In fact it just angers me.	0
Toast, as you might have guessed from the other reviews, is a place where celebrities and would-be celebrities congregate for chic and hip dining during the day. When I went, I swear everyone, including the staff, looked like they could be a model, a movie star, or some other celebrity. In short, everyone was beautiful.Ok, but on to the food. The food was very tasty and well prepared. I had the french toast with mixed berries while my girlfriend had the portabella mushroom omelette. Both plates were fantastic. And from the look of what other people were having, it seems like the food is generally really good. As for the service, it was indeed quick and were cheerful and friendly. It makes up for the long wait you will need to endure if you go during peek hours (9am-12pm on a weekend).Yay, four star review!	1
Pastrami sandwich: piled high with lean, tasty, pastrami on very good rye bread. Good selection of spicy mustards<br>Stuffed cabbage entree: sweet and sour. enormous portion. Hot and juicy. <br>Potato knish: not quite like I used to get in Coney Island but awfully close and just excellent.<br>Potato pancakes: spiced just right and fried to a crisp.<br>Corn rye bread from the bakery: the best I&#39;ve eaten in years.<br>Cherry phosphate for me: I&#39;m 14 again. Guiness for my wife: there are Jews in Ireland, you know. And there are Irish Americans eating pastrami sandwiches in Canter&#39;s who like Guiness with their meal.<br>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve enjoyed a meal this much in a long time. 75% good comfort food, 25% nostalgia for my teen years.	1
My husband and I decided to eat at Bahama Breeze for our Valentine&#39;s Dinner. We were seated quickly, and our server was also quick to take our order. For the emptiness of the restaurant, our burgers took a very long 20 minutes. You couldn&#39;t tell there was any cheese on our burgers and the lettuce and tomatoes were old and soggy. We got our burgers at 10:10 and that was the last time we saw our sever until 10:40 to get our check. We will not be returning to this restaurant.	0
Amazing! Great prices. The neighborhood is sketchy at best but it&#39;s well worth it. Don&#39;t expect great customer service or even a smile but the curtido makes up for it. The only thing I don&#39;t understand is why they use pinto beans instead of black or red beans with the eggs and platanos which is why I gave 4 stars...	1
We went at vero last week and we try the special cappellacci beef and mushroom served with white sauce fantastic .. The service Was excellent .. I really love the place	1
Pho is good but on the lighter side. It was still good and definitely not bland. I added some of the chef&#39;s &#34;special&#39;s sauce&#34; in my broth along with sriracha and it gave it a punch that I enjoyed. <br>The owner is really nice and even gave me extra broth and noodles without me asking. <br><br>I would go back. The shrimp spring rolls and BBQ pork were really good and fresh.<br><br>The chef&#39;s &#34;special&#39;s sauce&#34; is a hit with all of the above. Yum!	1
Great chicken burger, brioche buns x secret sauce = good eating	1
I have now dined at 2 of these restaurants (Chicago and Boston) and I must say that BOTH times I've walked away impressed by the food and the service....even though I was expecting it!	1
Very fresh food and they give you ice cream at the end of your meal. Well, at least for lunch they do.	1
I would like to stop exercising and healthful living/eating and try to shack up in Canter&#39;s for a month. The results may not be pretty but I am ready. The place is a time warp with deep Jewish history that fascinates me. <br><br>The place is a 24 hr diner but I really am only able to comment on the fabulous chocolate ruggalah and sweet orange/cinnamon/raisin bread we got. Both were fabulous but I want to try it again. I will force my LA friends to take me there in a few months when I am back down. Fortunately they have parking next door with the friendliest attendant ever and he made up for the straight faced teen working the pastry counter.	1
Bleh - First time , today is Tuesday , and I order some tostones ( they were really bad )! With Maicitos , bad presentation ,the service was ok , the lady look pretty bored and tired . Not coming aging , somehow disappointed .	0
One of my favorites... <br>It is one of those places where &#34;everybody knows your nameeee&#34;... The sushi is not the best sushi in town, but it&#39;s good! I usually have the rainbow roll with brown rice and it never disappoints me... My husband always, yes always, gets the gyoza platter (5 steamed gyozas with salad and rice). <br>During Christmas they had a very nice gesture with their customers, they gave out 10% off coupons and a set of really nice chop sticks... We went like 4 times in December, so we are hooked up with 4 discounted meals until June and plenty of chop sticks to throw a Japanese themed night dinner at home. <br>I highly recommend this place for what it is... A homey, good sushi restaurants with very, very decent prices.	1
Went here with some friends for DineLA and the experience with mediocre. They were missing two of the items on the DineLA menu because they didn't have them in stock. They got our order wrong, we asked for no bleu cheese in "The Six" burger and their service was subpar.We asked multiple times about the status of our order and one of the waiters from the back said it'd be one more minute when we ended up waiting for another 5 minutes on top of already extensive wait. Some of the food was good but I wouldn't come back and I certainly wouldn't come back for the service.	0
while out for our evening stroll, my husband and I decided to stop in for a bite. it was their first day open and we had been anxiously awaiting this new restaurant. the staff were very accomodating (we had the baby in a stroller) and prompt. while there were two awful servers, the rest seem to have plenty of fine dining experience and soon eclipsed the bumbling amateurs, taking over where those two fell behind. I know it is common to overhire for an opening and then weed out the less talented, so those two servers are likely gone hy now. the food. wow. I was unable to spend much time at table, as my munchkin decided to become cranky right after we ordered. there I was, walking to and fro, bouncing my chubby little guy whilemy husband enjoyed what looked like black ravioli (made wih squid ink). he thoroughly enjoyed every bite, then took our baby for some play time at the fountain whilst mom ate her own food. I had the Other ravioli, which was delicious. next time we will make it a grown ups only event so that we may enjoy our repast more fully.	1
Denny's for the hip and hopeless.	0
Perch has got some serious style... and we didn't even go the rooftop bar. Came here for dinner and it takes 2 elevators to get to the floor for dining. Vaulted ceilings with low lighting set the standard. We also sat in a small table facing most of the restaurant and bar. Nice lounge chairs instead of dining chairs at our particular table. A basic heirloom tomato salad to start. Salmon for the main dish. Solid entree along with a few bites of risotto from Rachel's plate. The only downside was the dessert. The bread pudding was a bit dry and came out piping hot. As we stepped outside on our way to catch a flick, a massive line had formed to get in. Next time, I'll head up to the rooftop.	1
Best breakfast ever. Open 27/7 365. No locks on doors. A restaurant of restaurants!!!!!!!!!!	1
Celebrated my birthday here because it looked tasty and was near my brother&#39;s house and I&#39;m very glad we did. The service was enthusiastic. The wine and beer selection were small but well curated. The space was cool and unusual (it&#39;s pretty much a small, southern-style house). The food was delicious and reasonably priced. We had a bottle of wine and some beers along with the beef cheeks and hummus, lamb belly, roasted cauliflower and Jerusalem artichokes. Mediterranean comfort food. Everything was excellent. The waitress seemed a little frazzled but was super friendly and offered lots of menu advice. Will dine there again.	1
More like 3.5 stars. The chicken fingers here are not brought in on a truck frozen they are made fresh. The chicken is seasoned nice and I like to add their hot sauce to the sandwich combo they have. The coleslaw was not good in my opinion and the fries are good if you eat them right away but don&#39;t hold up well if you get your order from the drive thru and eat at home. Decent option from the usual burger fast good options.	1
My fiance and I went to Fogo de Chao for Valentine's Day this year and to celebrate his birthday.  We had an 8:00 reservation however, we were taken to our table as soon as we walked in the door (7:45 or so).  A waiter quickly came to our table to explain how the restaurant worked and offered us a wine menu.  The drinks took some time to arrive but that was fine because we were in  no rush.  The salad bar is fantastic, there were several choices and the food looked fresh and well stocked. Once we moved on to the meat portion, it took some time for the various servers to arrive but again, we weren't in a rush.  The check took an unusually long time to arrive. Aside from that, everything was great, the atmosphere was romantic and perfect for valentine's day.  I look forward to coming back.	0
Super awesome view of DTLA. Eclectic crowd ranging in age from mid 20&#39;s to early 40&#39;s (me, lol). No stupid attitude patrons, great staff, and not too crowded that you can&#39;t move. I&#39;ve been here on Saturday night a handful of times and have yet to not enjoy. Drinks are typically priced for the area (about $8 to $10 for a mixed drink). Do arrive early unless you like to stand in line for 45 minutes. It happened to me but the doorman and hostess were not snooty or anything like that. Totally professional pair of people. Also, the DJ that night was nice enough to explain her sound system to me while she mixed the tunes. How nice is that? Pros: No cover, the view, easy to get to, good bartenders, chill crowd. Cons: I can&#39;t party there as often as I would like :-(	1
Best Pizza in Seattle.	1
I am now officialy a hater! I&#39;ve never been so humiliated!! Went there a couple times with friends on Friday nights for drinks and liked the atmosphere. This Saturday for a late lunch I felt like going back for a burger. I stepped it with my husband, asked for table, looked in the room and was happy to see a few tables available by the window but the hostess told us with the most condecedent tone that they didn&#39;t have any table available before a half hour!!!!!!!!!!! :o What the F!!!!	0
This was my 2nd Anniversary and we wanted a 'little- special' nite.  Bacio was good, but not really 'what' I had envisioned my night being.  No fault of the Restaurant..just not really as Romantic and Quaint as I had hoped for.	1
There is no comparison, it&#39;s like a time machine back to 1920&#39;s Paris. My wife and I can&#39;t stay away from this place. The food, the atmosphere, the staff. We always ask for Carlina because she&#39;s just awesome. Can&#39;t wait to go again, and again.	1
Love this place. Needed a meal at around 11 PM, hadn&#39;t had time to eat much all day and I had to go to the gym afterwards. I assumed my only choices would be crappy fast food. Somehow I found this place on yelp and not only is it open till 3 AM, it&#39;s super healthy and delicious. The lady helping me was very nice, she made a great turkey sandwich, brought it to my table with silverware and the whole deal, all for 6 bucks! They have these protein snacks that looked pretty good, will have to try that next time.	1
Im sorry, I know many people think this joint is the business but No. <br><br>I ordered the Daikoku ramen expecting to have a Foodgasm but all I got was an <br>egg-y greasy tasting bowl of ramen. Would I give this spot a second try? I think not, <br><br>Can I have my 25 cent pack of Top Ramen Noodles? Thank You!	0
Excellent for lunch. A variety of items depending on how hungry you are. Only problem parking is ltd	1
I went to Tanglewood for lunch this week and it was great! I love the updates they made from the previous restaurant especially the bar around the kitchen to allow patrons to sit and watch the chefs work. 	1
OMWord.Went there because there was SUCH great reviews on the place as dog friendly. Your pet has to stay out on the "patio" which is tiny metal racks welded into the sides of the walls as tables back to back in the sidewalk area. The height of my dinning experience? The homeless woman who dropped her pants at the curb side drain and took a dump while we ate. Followed by two homeless men who did the same. 1:00 in the afternoon. Joy unconfined.The waitress was nice enough and brought out the standard paper dish of water for the pooch. same routine for all dog owners. Drop the water, pet the pooch, smile walk away. okay got it. dogs welcome. Outside of course.After going in to use the restroom (single male female toilet and sink;don't touch anything!) and seeing first hand how dirty, run down and need of repair the restaurant was the dog had the best seat in the house. Ordered the turkey burger 9.00 no fries said came with pecan coleslaw. At first I thought the patty was missing. then I found it. You know how the big mac patty is so much thinner and smaller than the bread.......well there you have it. Lots and lots and lots of bread. topped with coleslaw. Ate the patty left the rest. Waitress was kind enough to offer a doggie bag. no thanks.My guest got the fries and chicken strips he said the chicken strips were great but the fries were limp and greasy. I tasted a couple and they weren't cooked at a hot enough temp and absorbed quite a bit of grease. didn't eat the fries. Bring a doggie pad for the dog to lay on. I gave mine a bath after he sat on that sidewalk. After all the positive reviews I was very disappointed...and surprised at the 'ambiance' Most say it's one step above a Denny's. Even the very worst Denny's I've ever stopped at during a road trip has this place beat hands down.	0
What a special place for lunch! We sat on the Patio overlooking the waterfalls and golf course. Great food --- try the lobster Cobb--- and attentive, professional service.	1
CASH ONLY DINER. The set up is inefficient but nostalgic. The food is OVERPRICED and not even that tasty. The apple and pecan pies were two thumbs down. The old school waiter has his job down to a science. I tipped him 40% for being so dedicated but I&#39;ll never go back and drop $35 for a burger combo (one steak burger, one fry, one apple pie, one pecan pie and one big fat tip). 5 Guys burgers and fries are waaayyy better on all accounts.	0
I&#39;m not one to give a bad review but when a place really misses its mark, I am definitely going to share what I went through. <br><br>We went there on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant wasn&#39;t even that busy, in fact I had the largest party (of 7) when I arrived. The server automatically brought out waters but took a couple of minutes for the menu to get to me after he was ready to take my order and realized I didn&#39;t have one. <br><br>I ordered the whole duck which came to my table room temperature, it wasn&#39;t even hot to enjoy that parts of the duck that contained a high portion of fat was too fatty to bite into. <br>The Shrimp &amp; Combination Fried Rice wasn&#39;t too bad but wasn&#39;t the best either. The ratio of noodle to veggies/seafood for their pan fried noodle wasn&#39;t well proportioned (lacked so much noodles) and finally when I ordered the pigs ear in soy sauce &amp; the spicy chicken feet, it would&#39;ve been nice to be told that these were cold appetizers. <br><br>My server was too busy catering to the other customers who were Chinese unlike me &amp; my party who were not. Even to get a water refill was almost impossible. I can guarantee you that this is definitely the first &amp; LAST time I&#39;ll be ever eating here &amp; I work for the hotel industry so I can assure you that I will spread the word to my friends that this place is by far a horrible choice to make! If I could rate it with negative stars, trust me, I would have!!<br><br>I was so disappointed because for the first time I went to a high rated establishment that was a total false rated place for me.	0
I love the food, but the service left a very bad taste in my mouth. I won&#39;t be back.<br><br>I work nearby and had a series of late nights at the office last week, so I ordered dinner from here twice during those few days. The orders were a little messed up -- two drinks were missing form the first one, and an extra item (well, a handful of tortilla chips) was added to the second. But both times I was made to feel like I was responsible for the mistake. <br><br>With the missing drinks from the first order, the cashier stopped just short of accusing me of stealing or hiding them. He told me that I had received them, and proceeded to search the to-go bag and look me up and down in an attempt to find me out as some sort of Orangina thief. I did eventually receive the two Oranginas I ordered -- because he was wrong and had forgotten to give them to me -- but not before I was made to feel like some sort of fast-casual restaurant swindler. <br><br>And with the second order, the cashier accused me of wanting freebies when I voiced my concern as she began to take my entire order apart. You see, some tortilla chips had mistakenly made their way into the box where my sandwich was packaged. The cashier opened the box, dumped out the chips, compromised the structural integrity of an already sloppy sandwich, and proceeded to double check all of the boxes for stowaway chips! I feel like that was a little overboard for some soggy chips the kitchen staff threw away anyway. And to accuse me of trying to get free things from the restaurant was way out of line. <br><br>That&#39;s just some poor training and some lack of common sense (and decency, I think). People make mistakes and that&#39;s fine, but handle yourselves with some class. Like I said before, I won&#39;t be back.	0
Sweet<br>Salty<br>Savory<br><br>Spectacular<br><br>Now I understand why the lady this small space is named for is so well known in the food world. Honestly, when my Arepa De Chocolo was placed in front of me I thought, how good could it possibly be? Really doesn&#39;t look like much for $4. What it is... a spectacular simple dish made of humble ingredients turned into a meal of pure brilliance, bliss. It will take awhile to forget the experience. Paired with a simple cup of black Columbian coffee I left a very happy man. The savory of the corn, the sweetness of the butter, the salty cheese, the combination a little bit of heaven that doesn&#39;t happen by accident.<br><br>Best part? Take the Q70 from Laguardia and they drop you off within two blocks of the place. Yet another reason to bypass the annoying yellow cabs with their surly drivers and overpriced ride in a vehicle with no shocks on bad roads.<br><br>In a city filled with overly hyped, over priced food, a little spot of heaven. After a 1,300+ mile flight, the reward at the end most worthy of the effort. Who ever said you had to spend a lot of money in NYC to eat world class? Some fool that never dined here.	1
Los Gemelos might finally be the eatery to stick in this East Gilman location that briefly housed one of those forgettable chain calzone joints. In its place is a colorful yet no-nonsense big city-style taqueria - think Chicago, San Francisco and so on. Walk up to the counter and put in your order with the friendly female proprietor. Choose from a full menu of options, including quesadillas, tamales, burritos and so on, or stick with the classic steak, or carne asada, taco, served traditional-style with onion and cilantro. The tacos come delivered to you, in the late hours, in a paper bag; find your seat, remove and unroll the little bundles of joy and - wait! Be sure to apply what appears to be house-made salsa (I recommend the green sauce), then enjoy. For a couple of bucks per taco, you will be hard-pressed to find a tastier, less expensive and higher-quality product in the downtown area, particularly in the post-dinner hours.	1
I concur with others that the service is subpar. The sign in front says wait to be seated, but they seem surprised to see you standing there! The waitress was also a bit ignorant.On the contrary, the Ramen hands down was the best I've had in my life. I'm not a ramen Expert, but I've a good stint at Ramens in this town. 5th one thing that makes this place stand out is the quality of the ingredients compared to other places that smell like grease and grit. I'll be back!	1
Good, cheap tacos on tuesday but outdated specials on yelp and outside. Not so big on the snarky bumper stickers inside, but can&#39;t really complain about dollar tacos.	1
The D&#39;Pinoy serving crew &amp; staff were hospitably friendly in welcoming me to their dining establishment. After truckin&#39; all those longhaul miles,it&#39;s nice to see friendly people....<br>The restaurant had some sort of cultural #get2gether with some cool,easy listening live music!! This was a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy eating my #karekare OxTail stew n rice selection!<br>Now...back to the regularly scheduled sunday agenda!	1
What a disappointment.Our small group was seated in the back in a room of large parties--we literally had to scream over the thumping backround music(?) and large drunken parties shouting.The service was terrible-a waitress with an attitude and we had to ask 4 times to have our water glasses filled.Food was ok but not worth going out of your way for.Never go on a Saturday night--I say stay clear of this place!	0
This was truly a bad meal. I ordered the Chopped Beef Brisket Sandwich. It was described as coming with fried onions & horseradish mayo on sourdough. What came out was a sloppy mess. The beef was mostly gristle and it was drenched in a poorly made bbq sauce. They should have used a sourdough roll instead of sliced sourdough because it ended up just being a sponge for the nasty sauce. We also ordered the BLT salad w/ chicken extra. The salad arrived without chicken, so the waitress said she'd bring it right out. After 15 minutes, it still hadn't arrived so we cancelled the chicken. (Oddly enough, the chicken still arrived on our bill.) You'd think that a salad full of blue cheese, bacon & avocado would be bursting with flavor, yet somehow they were able to sap the taste out of that as well. All the while, though the restaurant was sparsely filled, it was impossible to find our waitress. We both wanted to send our meals back, but had little faith that the kitchen would be able to execute anything edible or that our waitress would deliver it in time.The place deserves one star, but I give it two because 1. It was clean. 2. I was donkey enough to expect decent food at the wharf.If you need to eat near the wharf, just hit In-N-Out, Eagle Cafe, Caesar's a couple blocks away, or Sweetie's.	0
We always come here for desserts n appetizers plus the wines, great selections. The ever delicious pudding, oh my! my never ending craving is always satisfied. As usual, reservations is a must so u don&#39;t hav to wait. Their appetizers is one I say the best, of all the restaurants I&#39;ve been n Dtla. Although its a bit pricey n servings r small, we always order double portions. The best of all is the customer service, I&#39;ve been here 5x n its always a pleasurable experienced n well entertained. Plus the nice view n ambience, I always recommend this place to my friends	1
The bartender was extremely rude, don't get the Margarita.... It tastes horrible and if you say anything about it, they will give you grief, not worth it!!!	0
The food was excellent, the service was excellent, and the ambiance was great. If your from Vegas or just visiting Vegas this is a must try. One of if not the best Michael Mina restaurants I&#39;ve been to. I highly recommend trying the beef tartare and the Duroc pork chop.	1
Been to this fine establishment several times within a one month period. A clear indication that I like. The cuisine has southern and caribbean influences such as their whole porgy with hot peppers reminiscent of an escoveitch. Other standouts were the slow cooked oxtail and that delicious fried chicken. Portions on the chicken were generous one night then significantly smaller on the most recent visit so they need to work on their consistency. Hope they bring back Not Another Kale Salad which was a great appetite opener. All in all a comfortable neighborhood feel and good solid food.	1
I love this place. Very old school! Their burgers are alright (I&#39;ve had better) but I absolutely love their french fries. And if you love pie - this is the place to go to. Their apple pie and banana cream pie are fantastic. (You&#39;ll have to drop by before 8 pm if you want the banana cream pie). <br><br>Note: The wait can be verryyyyyyyy long if you wanna sit down.	1
The Seafood Risotto special on Sat. night was outstanding.  The flavors were excellent with the exotic mushrooms.	0
Amazing happy hour specials including food. Food pretty middle of road but good selection.	1
Although I'm not much of a carnivore, every now and then I feel a certain craving for the noblest cut of the cow--the tongue. Back when I was in Japan I found out that the most delicious and the only way to cook this oft-overlooked part of the cow is to peel off the thick hide from the tongue thus revealing the soft juicy meat under it, perhaps season it with a little salt and then grill the gorgeous thin cuts of meat over a charcoal fire. I was very disappointed to find that the tongue never made it as a staple cut in the American beef diet, but my disappointment was set aback when I found out that the pan-Americans and the magical restaurants that have so become ubiquitous to American cities known as "Taquerias" usually carry my preferred cut of beef as part of their delicious burrito menu. This all changed tonight when I visited El Rancho Grande.Fueled partially by an initiative to explore my immediate surroundings a little thoroughly and partially by a drunken escapade, I decided to try out the taqueria that's exactly two and a half blocks away from where I live. My first impressions of the establishment was no different from any other Taquerias I've visited all around California; little cashier's booth under neath a giant menu conveniently located aside the actual "cooking area", seats lined up across the wall with a TV playing Mexican soaps/futbol on telemundo. So assuring myself that this experience would not be any different from my usual frequentings, I decided to order my favorite cut of beef wrapped around a tortilla stuffed with rice, beans, sour cream, diced tomatoes and onion and guacamole. How can you possibly mess this up, right?Well that's where I was wrong. I'm not a burrito scientist, but the first sign of a poorly made burrito can be observed through the color of the tortilla; the tortilla was toasted/browned--to date I've never had a single positive experience with burritos when the tortilla was (nearly) burnt to a crisp. My next grievance with ERG's burrito is that the queso they used overpowered almost every flavor the burrito had to offer--if I wanted a cheesy filling Mexican dish wrapped in a tortilla I would have ordered a quesadilla. My last and final grievance with RG's lengua burrito is that it managed to capture every reason why white people don't usually eat this cut of meat; they somehow managed to overboil the lengua and thus leaving it devoid of any sort of flavor/texture whatsoever. Now I'm very passionate about my beef tongue so perhaps it's not in anyone's best interest to take what I say about this burrito au pied de la lettre, but this burrito managed to betray every expectation about the noblest cut of the beef: whereas I expected a succulent, juicy, flavorful sensation with each bite, all I got was a mushy, watery concoction that was overpowered by the overly generous flavor of cheese.Besides from the disappointing lengua burrito, the chips they gave me were the super greasy home-fried kind, which I imagine might be a plus for some and a huge gaping minus for others including myself, and their pathetic excuse for a salsa bar only had four choices: salsa verde, not-so-spicy red salsa, pico de gallo and another thing that I cannot remember at this point.Despite all their shortcomings, their food is surprisingly affordable (6.95 for a super burrito) which, in my opinion, is the only thing preventing me from giving this place a one star review. Since I was a little intoxicated when I tried this place and out of the virtue that this place is only 2.5 blocks away from where I live, I'll give this place another try on my next drunken escapade, but I know when I've been thoroughly disappointed and betrayed and this experience came mighty close to it.	0
The decor in this place is really cute. It reminds me of a cool Seattle coffee shop. Unfortunately for me, the decor is where the charm ends. This is one of those partial service establishments, where you order at the counter and serve yourself for things like beverages, condiments and water but they will bring you your food. If you're going to run an operation like this, the food either needs to be decently priced or it needs to be really good. Think Huckleberry in Santa Monica. Paper or Plastik Cafe had none of those things going for it. In a nutshell, it was bad service for over priced food that wasn't very good. When my husband and I went to order at the counter, at 10am on a Friday, they were already out of half of their menu. There's nothing that vexes me more than a restaurant that runs out of things... especially when the menu is small to begin with. The only reason for this is poor planning/execution on the part of management. My husband ordered a plan B option (they were out of huevos rancheros)... a breakfast sandwich with regular bread because they were out of biscuits. I ordered the asparagus omelet and the Zambia coffee. They brew the coffee using a Melitta which I thought was cool at first.... but the consequence of this is that the coffee gets cold quickly. My coffee was lukewarm by the time I got it and I overheard somebody go up to the counter with the same problem. The guy behind the counter said "I'm sorry but we don't have any microwaves here." If your coffee gets cold here you're out of luck. The coffee was not very good either :/The next problem was with the food itself. My omelet was just ok. It was packed to the gills with ricotta cheese that was under seasoned. I had to douse it in sriracha just to get it down. The toast it came with was cardboard-y. They didn't even serve it with any butter or jam. I asked the server for jam and he said they had some strawberry but it expired (note: wtf??). For $12+ this is unacceptable. My husband thought his sandwich was incredibly underwhelming. It was on the same cardboard-y bread as my toast and it wasn't something we couldn't throw together at home. My last issue was with the water which is in a serve-yourself beverage tub near the front door. They have the tiniest plastic 4oz cups next to it. The least they could do is offer larger cups or give you a glass bottle filled with water to take back to your table so you don't have to get up several times to refill. This place might be a cool college hang out (although I hear they're particularly strict about sitting around with your laptop) but they certainly aren't a real player in the LA breakfast/coffee scene. We wont be back.	0
Went for brunch. Delicious extremely creative food. Servers went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. Love the interior to	1
Awesome! I had the family meal. I love this place. I&#39;ll be coming back to try everything else on the menu!	1
The worst place to have spent Valentine&#39;s Day. Yes, the view was nice and the waiters were on point for the whole evening. But the food was horrible! No taste, and itty bitty portions for both my husband and I! It was a set menu so we thought it would be a play for each, but no. Our food came in one plate...the plates were big for no reason. The food could have fit in a mini bowl. We paid $65 PER PERSON For five VERY small portions. The dessert was by far the most awful. I could have made it at home with sugar cookies and whipped cream from the 99 cent store. Hubby and I were very disappointed and couldn&#39;t wait to leave. I don&#39;t recommend anyone to come to this place if you&#39;re looking for a nice dinner.	0
Cocktails are decent. Good for lunch. Dinner atmosphere very loud, trendy, and cramped.	1
We had a girls night here with 5 of us sampling a variety of food, which all tasted good....until we all became violently sick with the exact same symptoms 24 hours later. This is the only thing we shared in common. When we notified the restaurant, no one from our group was contacted back. We have a report in with 311. So be careful.	0
thanks to groupon, i only paid 6 bucks for a meal for two. we ordered a potato knish with gravy on the side and a beef dip. ok first the knish, it's good and is a huge ball of basically mashed potatoes with a bread coating. dipping it into the gravy it tastes like thanksgiving potatoes. it's good, but i mean, it's just potatoes and gravy. my bf says it's his favorite thing to get and was ranting and raving about how good it is. the beef dip was ok. it was dry as hell even with the dip. i am not a fan. i wanted to try the pastrami and maybe thats where we went wrong because that looked a little better than the beef dip we had. the fries are good though. they were the highlight of our meal.free parking in a lot on the side of the building, which is another plus. if we ever go back i'll have to try the matzo ball soup or the pastrami to see what the hype is all about.	0
Refused service with foreign ID - I was trying to have a drink with a friend but the barkeeper refused to serve me, although I showed him an official Swiss ID card, that I&#39;d used before in that bar. He said: &#34;I can&#39;t accept anything that&#39;s not American.&#34; Bummer.	0
food was ok. the waitress was really rude? not rude but just...idk I guess she was rude. the food was just ok. the white rice tasted like the rice I make at home in my cooker. wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. 2 stars because the prices were good but the service was horrible.	0
Man the pastrami was super delicious. It had thick juicy slices of heaven. The sandwich is a tad bit high but worth the cost	1
So glad I tried this place. Amazing French Toast ! Try a Switchel cocktail. Had one top off with rum it was delicious. Love the outdoorsy atmosphere. Won&#39;t be long before this place is packed.	1
I&#39;m not sure if I would come here again. The resturant only had two tables being used but the service to order took forever. It was almost 30 minutes just to order. The hostess waiter guy wearing all black just cared way too much about chatting about hiring a new bartender girl who was refferred from john who will come in for a interview yesterday. They were talking so loud you can hear there convo from the other end of the resturant. Secondly I told the waiter no tomatoes but when my meal came out you can see a huge slice of tomatoes. So they brought it back and I again had to wait another 20 minutes. I was starving so its not a good sign. So my meal comes out the meat is completely red once you bite into it. I ask for medium very well cook fully but ughhh the waiter. I didn&#39;t enjoy my hamburger meal at all. The hamburger was filled with oil in the bun. Gross. I&#39;ve been to hamburger places where they cook the hamburger in greese for flavoring but this place the greese is like a waterfall coming down.	0
All I wanted was some decent curry close to my house.	0
Waited 30 minutes for a seat when there were seats available... Then waited 15/20 min for a damn coffee and some tea. Ridiculously snobby people... ridiculously snobby waitress... Ugh. Sooo irate! Don&#39;t bother to go here... EVER!	0
I like this place, and its atmosphere and location, and I am thrilled with its concept of gin-based cocktails - my favorite liquor. The problem is in the cocktails themselves: I tasted a few, and they all were far too sweet, syrupy, too heavy to perceive the gin. Some of the Whistler&#39;s drinks have this problem from time to time as well, but this was far worse. The Basil Bramble, for all the grenadine (or whatever it was), tasted like a pleasant citrusy and fruity beverage with an alcohol kick. The juniper subtlety of the North Shore gin was lost. The martinez had a similar problem.<br><br>My advice is to enlarge the cocktail menu to include classic, time-tested drinks which are not afraid to foreground the taste of gin.	0
Isn't this same as Serious Biscuit? I am serious :)	0
I must admit that I was skeptical about this place. I'm still trying to detox from thanksgiving, and wasn't too optimistic about a place with burgers in the headline...But, it was ok! The service was good - the decor was fascinatingly eclectic, and the food was fine. It's nothing original, but nonetheless, hit the spot. I had the breakfast special, 2 scrambled eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 strips of bacon. I couldn't even pretend to finish it...Two and a half stars because it wasn't anything special, but the service was good.	0
Came here on a Monday night and had the fish tacos special ($1 each). They were amazing!!! Purchase of a drink required to have the special. Could be non-alcoholic. I ordered a hot chamomile tea. Highly recommended!	1
I decided to try out The Brixton with my boyfriend for our Valentines date, having seen decent reviews and a constant crowd. I was underwhelmed to say the least...PROS- While waiting at the bar for our table I had the Bourbon Rasperry Splash, it was delicious and the bartender great. Definitely the best part of our eveningCONS- Freezing inside the restaurant-Ordered the spinach artichoke dip for an app. Waitress brought out the wrong thing then started going on about how unorganized the kitchen is. When we finally got the right appetizer it was runny cheese with no flavor, added salt which helped some. Served with crostini so thin it broke when you tried to scoop anything.- I had the gnocchi which was served on a hot plate, yet the entree was cold. The gnocchi was rubbery and undercooked, awful presentation also. I am a pasta lover and for the first time in my life didn't finish a pasta dish!- My boyfriend ordered the burger medium rare, It came well done. He also found a decent sized bone...in a burger! I'm a vegetarian and don't know much about meat, but never in my life has someone bitten into a burger at a nice restaurant and pulled out a bone. He left about half of it uneaten-Review of clam chowder from bf: stick with Campbells-Waitress was overly flirtatious with my boyfriend, which i did not appreciate on our romantic night out. I will definitely not be returning to The Brixton. If crappy food and overly pretentious people are your thing, by all means, be my guest	0
Pretty small menu- we ended up getting a drink at Roy's and then going across the street to eat.	0
Enjoyed it a lot. Very personal service, great food. Nice neighborhood joint.	1
Rip off. The food was crap. Tasted like some kind of chain restaurant crap that I could have gotten at Olive Garden. For the price, I was VERY disappointed. This place is a must miss!<br>The chicken parm was just a piece of chicken with sauce and cheese slapped on it with a high price tag. Save your money and go elsewhere.	0
Great service with huge portions of traditional Orleans Food at very reasonable prices. I always stay at the Orleans Hotel and eat in this restaurant	1
We had a large bachelor party booked here for months. Due to administrative error (double booking by their staff) we were told we could be seated in different areas (not as a group) or to find another venue. One star for lack of flexibility, poor customer service, and because Yelp won&#39;t let me give a zero. Sad I&#39;ll miss out trying the place as it was hyped by the organizer, but I hold a mean grudge once burned.	0
Really delicious steak. Cooked to perfection. The portions were also huge, so come hunger.	1
Chill, relaxed atmosphere. The drunken fish soup is SO GOOD. The menu is definitely peculiar which I always like. Looks like a family run place which translates to very friendly and personable staff. Should give it a go	1
We were really excited to for our brunch here, and totally disappointed. Everything on the menu sounds amazing, but almost everything we got was bland or disappointing. <br><br>Monkey bread: extremely dense nuggets of tasteless dough soaking in very thin syrup. <br><br>Chopped salad: decent, a little bit too sweet, but nice and crunchy. Definitely the best thing we ordered. <br><br>Popover benedict: popover was dry, had none of the satisfying qualities of a popover. Extremely bland, needed lots of salt. Everything was creamy/mushy, needed some kind of textural contrast. <br><br>Rib hash with poached egg: not in any way a hash. This was just hunks of meat and potatoes. Some pieces of meat were really tender and flavorful, some were dry. The potatoes were crispy and nice. Not bad, but was boring and, again, not actually hash. <br><br>Cheesy grits: not cheesy. More watery than creamy. Not disgusting, but not good. Flavorless. <br><br>The food also took forever to come.	0
First night in Chicago and this did not disappoint. C&#39;mon, &#34;The Local&#34;? Had to be decent. My pal and I split the special (Lobster Boil) as well as the 16 prime rib. So &#39;ono. Got a side of grits and sauteed mushrooms as well. Feast for royalty.	1
I was disappointed on my second visit to Bianca&#39;s Restaurant. I ordered the Gramigna con salciccia e peperoni, which is the same dish I ordered the first time I ate here because that time, this dish tasted delicious. Did they change chefs? I don&#39;t know, it just didn&#39;t taste as good. Another thing I didn&#39;t like was the atmosphere of the restaurant, it was very noisy during the evening or dinner time. Some people would say the table set up was intimate, but to me, it just looked crowded. Isn&#39;t it a code violation or a hazard in case of an emergency evacuation to have that many tables situated very close to each other in such a small space? Also, there&#39;s nothing pleasant about eating inches away from another diner&#39;s table and on top of it, the noise level is not an ideal atmosphere to catch up with friends for dinner. If you do decide to still eat here, I advise that you bring enough cash because they don&#39;t accept credit cards.	0
I'm always running around, trying to find new spots to enjoy a good cup of coffee. This happens to be one of the first cafes I checked out when I moved to madison a few months ago.	0
Da. Hype. Iz. Real.	1
I dined there with a date for Restaurant Week, and I have found a gem.  The location is convenient with historic architecture, and the service was outstanding.  Starting off with a bannini cocktail, it had the right combination of liqueurs and is now a favorite of mine.  The vegetarian baklava was creative, very flavorful without gimmicks, and well presented.  Absolutely delicious.  The portions are generous, the service was very attentive but unobtrusive, and the setting is very romantic.  Chef Wecker visited the tables toward the end of the evening and spent a few minutes answering questions about the history of the inn and more.  I will dine there often.	0
It pains me that a meal this wonderful is all too rare an occasion. I parked nearby expecting only a light meal, but got so much more. I indulged and had the tasting menu with pairings. I almost regretted eating in-n-out an hour before, and that's nearly blasphemy. We began with an oyster topped with caviar, and the wonderful luxuries of the menu unfolded from there. It would be exhausting to list all the delicacies, but these come to mind at the moment. As a fan of unusual cuisine, the sweet bread was a joy. A rich organ meat, its heartiness is divine. In another dish, a vibrant yellow aji sauce invigorated the tongue and hamachi sashimi. If I wrote this review another day, I would recall different dishes, but I will always praise the spectacular service I received at Ray's.Throughout my meal I was promptly and politely aided by two servers, both named Paul, and a series of other employees. The first Paul welcomed me into the restaurant's essentially transparent structure, and was engaging and charming. His description of the day's special, the sweet bread, truly inspired me to spring for the tasting, and his knowledge of the chosen wines is now a gem in my own sorely limited vault of sophistication. The other Paul, an equally pleasant and helpful server, as eloquently as the other informed us of our food's grandeur, all the while checking on us at comfortable intervals. The exemplary service, all the way down to the knowledgable food runners, when combined with the tantalizing plates invite the weary to relax and acknowledge that despite traffic, tickets, or any tough talk, life looks quite nice warmly watching the sun set from inside their glass haven.I will admit, there were some downsides to my experience at Ray's. I nearly slipped into a coma from licking the plate clean eight times. I flaked on a friend because I was enjoying myself there for too long. But my primary concern, the one issue stands above them all, is how can I do this more often?	1
The menu is huge! The place is outdated, as it should be. Two dining rooms and a second floor? Why so big? I had the hard salami on delicious rye bread. So good. Coleslaw was soso. I want to come back to try more on the menu.	1
Maybe I&#39;m a bit snobby when it comes to cuban food because I&#39;m from Miami, but this was ok. The food was fine but the portion was ridiculous. If I&#39;m going to pay 13 dollars for a dish that is consisted of rice beans and pork (as cheap as it gets to make) I expect to have a man sized portion. instead.... I got a $13 happy meal.	0
When you only have an hour for lunch, the choices are very limited. Especially since you have to take into consideration traffic time and cooking time. Lemon Poppy Kitchen was relatively close to my training site so my friends and I ventured over here for a quick bite to eat. It&#39;s a small little cafe. I can see it being very crowded during peak brunch and lunch hours. I also think their specialty is more towards breakfast rather than lunch since their lunch menu was extremely limited. Service was friendly though. <br><br>I ordered their turkey avocado salad. They actually didn&#39;t have any salads but apparently any of their sandwiches can be turned into a salad, so I opted for that. Maybe that&#39;s why my salad wasn&#39;t really all that great. I mean, it didn&#39;t taste bad or anything but it was just so boring. And I do like my salads underdressed but this was VERY underdressed. Bordering on raw. Which I could see as a huge turn off. Actually there wasn&#39;t a dressing at all. It was just straight up balsamic vinegar so I don&#39;t know if it would have helped that much. Some of my friends did order sandwiches but none of them finished. Actually one of my friends had an allergic reaction to it even though she specified before she ordered that she was allergic to a certain type of cheese and needed that changed. Maybe the servers just forgot. <br><br>Overall, for $9, i expected a better salad. A properly dressed salad for one and the portion size was ridiculously small too. Not too happy about it but maybe their brunch stuff is better. 2/5	0
Had been looking forward to the experience, booked ahead of time and arrived with my girlfriend early to our reservation but denied seating by the window because I was not &#34;dressed formally enough.&#34; The staff who was assigning seats seemed almost upset that I was simply wearing a jacket. Every customer in the restaurant was seated by the window, with about three window seats remaining. One seat remained empty for a good two hours. Food was well above average, amazing view, and our waiter was nice but the arrogance of the staff (both reception and seating) was pretty embarrassing. Would have just left if my girlfriend hasn&#39;t been looking forward to it for the last month. Not worth spending $360 to be treated like a second class citizen. Dress to impress the staff if you choose to dine here, because the food by itself wont do the price justice.	0
We came here for lunch while at LACMA. I was a bit disappointed after looking at the menu. Most of the items that I wanted to try weren't available until after 3PM, even for a pizza! Ended up sharing this house made pasta dish that I can't seem to remember the name. It was way too rich and buttery for my taste and the portion was tiny! We also had a beer and 1 well drink and tab came to $50w/tip. I don't mind paying for good food and drinks but that is a bit way overpriced for what it really is.	0
First time here and wasn&#39;t given any direction as to how to be seated. A server gave us attitude when asked her where we could sit. The wait staff in general was unsanitary and unprofessional. The bus boy was walking around with big headphones listening to music, the cook was on his cell phone while cooking and the cashier was sitting behind the counter eating. Overall there seems to be an unorganized structure of how this place operates. Then only good thing I can say is that my blueberry bagel was good. Will never come back here.	0
Went there because a friend had a coupon/online deal and decided to try it. <br>What a disappointment! <br>It&#39;s a mexican restaurant but they had NO AVOCADOS! (mind you, it&#39;s avocado season...send an employee to WinnDixie down the street if you have to!) <br>So there was no sliced avocado garnish for the salad or fish tacos and there was no guacamole. <br>Normally I would have left at this point but I was with two other friends and on a time crunch. <br>The fish tacos were only available fried and came with a heavy cream sauce that gave the plate a monotonous flavor.<br>The food overall was average, nothing to rave about and the only reason I would give it 2 stars, not 1 is because the waitress was doing her best to accommodate us. But I would much rather go to Taco Rico in the Gables, Guadalajara by the Falls or even Lime or Moe&#39;s for that matter!!	0
I let Sara the Bartender choose a cocktail and wine for my meal. She was awesome. I finished the dinner with the bolognese. I may be back this week!	1
Let me start by saying that they have the best burger that I&#39;ve tried in a long time - the mushroom and swiss with a veggie patty. However, I&#39;ve only been able to eat this in 1 out of 4 attempts. <br><br>The 2nd time we came they were out of veggie patties, along with soap in both bathrooms, paper towels in both bathrooms, and perhaps water because they never brought it to us. <br><br>The 3rd visit we came at 6:15pm on a Tuesday, knowing that they opened at 6pm. The door was locked and closed, no sign explaining. We waited 10 minutes and then left. <br><br>I came back tonight really wanting to eat the mushroom &amp; swiss again. They are chronically understaffed so we waited in line a line of 10 people for 15 minutes. The one girl working the front area is very nice but can&#39;t serve beer, run orders, take orders, clean tables, and bus tables on her own on a Saturday night. We finally got our order in and had a seat. 30 minutes later the overworked girl told us they were out of veggie patties. <br><br>This place has great food (when they have it) but I will not be coming back due to the chronic understaffing, poor customer service, and unreliability.	0
Incredible sushi joint. The staff is attentive and friendly. The waiter recognized me after coming in a few weeks in a row. The sushi is delicious and inexpensive. My entire lunch today cost $10 and I left feeling very satisfied. The spicy tuna roll and wakame soup (seaweed soup) are both amazing. The green tea mochi is good, but not amazing. I love this place and will definitely be back next week!	1
The food was okay, nothing amazing by any means, but the quality of service was awful. Waited and waited and rarely saw our server. Had to finally ask the bus boy for the check.	0
Delicious bakery and good coffee. What more can I say!	1
NEVER AGAIN.<br><br>Pies N Thighs has the right idea, but they fuck it up completely. <br>1. Catfish: Too much pepper and spices. It was extremely dry and it actually made me nauseous because the flavor was too strong.<br>2. Service: The man behind the counter was totally unwilling to assist, and had the &#34;don&#39;t ask me any more questions&#34; kind of attitude. You can tell that he works at a fried chicken joint...he was BIG.<br>3. Corn bread: Too crumbly! I think the most important aspect of a corn bread is the uncrumbliness. No one wants a corn bread that&#39;s gonna fall apart when you try to break off a part of it.<br>4. Price: It&#39;s overpriced<br>5. Customers: Every girl waiting outside to be seated talked very loudly and had the stupidest things to say. Ohh attention whores.	0
It was real full expect a bit of a wait, but the food was the best Cuban food I have tasted in a while. Believe the hype.	1
Their fiery "Bul-Dak" chicken is definitely fiery and tasty. I love the nurungji at the bottom. This is the kind of place that would be perfect at night when you're stoned and want some good food and cold beer.	1
I'm giving TP a 2-star rating instead of 3-stars because of customer service. My parents were visiting from CA and it was their first time to this restaurant. I had been raving about it and even saved it for their last night in town. We arrived at 9:30pm and went to grab a seat in the bar - I've always come at happy hour and sat in one of the bar booths at the back of the restaurant, so I brought my parents back there and sat down. A bar back brought us waters and we carried on our conversation. About 10 minutes later a rude waitress/server came over and asked who had sat us there. We told her there was no one up front to seat us and being that we'd always gone for open seating in the bar, that was what we did again. There wasn't a reserved table tent on the booth/table and no one even spoke to us until we were rudely told to get up and find another table. Looking around, I noticed there were 4 other empty tables in the restaurant, so we went to one of them and repositioned ourselves. Not a great way to start the meal.	1
Random find while passing by...super happy!Cute small dark bar & restuarant! The food was great! I had the bowery salad which was so tasty and my friends loved all their food. I totally enjoyed the vibe here at night. Very classy bar feel but with good food!If I lived in this city I'd make this my spot!	1
I have really mixed feeling reading this place. I think most of the staff and the owners and friendly and happy and want to do good. But they are the slowest when it comes to making food. I'm not talking about during the busy lunch hour, that I understand with a ton of people all at once. The mornings when there is one or two customers it usually takes 10-15 minutes to just get a bagel with cream cheese. I guess the cooks are prepping for the day. No sense or urgency at all. I stopped going there after more than once having to ask the counter person if my bagel was ready yet. It's close to my office, they use good ingredients, but they only seem to care about prepping for the lunch people. It's too bad. Stopped going there, doubt I would give them ano0ther chance after so many failures.	0
Neat, unique spot with good prices on tasty food. They slice the beef in front of you; It's not some slurry from a hose. Would return.	1
Yummy Southeast Asian flavors. Something as simple as their basic Coconut Lime Rice was so freakin good! Made with Jasmine rice, coconut milk and a hint of lime, BOMB! For Protein I was head over heals crazy in love with their Coconut Lemongrass Steak. I like my foods overloaded with Lemongrass flavor and this hit the spot. Wasn&#39;t a fan of the Shrimp &amp; Pork Meatballs rubbery texture. Apparently it&#39;s one of their top selling items but to each his own. <br><br>The SAMBAL TOFU looked real good though I haven&#39;t had the chance to try it yet. It&#39;s marinated organic tofu stir-fried in a lemongrass spice blend. Hello, Lemongrass! Must be delish! ;) <br><br>I looooove Kale, they offer it as a Veg topping! Either mixed with Baby kale and green leaf or as Green kale infused with garlic and ginger oil, sprinkled with salt and pepper.<br><br>Definitely recommend trying their Lychee Mint Tea. I believe they puree fresh lychee and use it as a base. Tastes so naturally sweet, tropical &amp; delicious. <br><br>For dessert they offer Kaya Toast. Wasn&#39;t familiar with this item until now. Looked up what Kaya was and apparently it&#39;s mainly found in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Kaya is like a fruit butter spread made with coconut milk, eggs and sugar. Very rich and fatty from the coconut milk which translates to tasty. <br><br>Overall, I was very pleased with this new casual joint. Very pleased to find something new and different from the norm.	1
Very good authentic food! The owner is very sweet and always make sure that you&#39;re satisfied. The only compliant I have is that the food takes long to come out.	1
Swear I walked past this place twice before I realized where it was, literally a whole in the wall!	0
From 3 to 4 stars	1
Have been here three times now and as other reviewers have noted, service can be really slow. I didn't mind waiting the first two times when it was fairly full. Was here on Saturday for lunch and place was half filled. Took awhile to get seated bcz waitress was doing her makeup near the beverage station. Took even longer to order although food came fast. Ramen was unevenly heated with cold potato chunks. The charming hand drawn menu and signs are gone. Very disappointed that the service has not improved in the last few months and that the quality of food has gone down. Not planning to return.	0
The only good thing were the garlic knots they served before our pizza and salad arrives.  The salad was wilted and the pizza was just ok...	0
This is a must do for all Chicagoans! Good burgers, amazing loaded fries and boozy milkshakes (which sadly I&#39;ve yet to try).<br><br>Small clean interior with 6 tables but I prefer the small 6 table sidewalk patio.<br><br>Both of our burgers were good , attributed in large part due to the sauces and toppings, the burger seemed to be a little dense and bland. Homemade buns topped with white and black sesame seeds was a nice touch and definitely held up to all the sauce slop!<br><br>Amazing Grace burger with Carolina BBQ sauce, fried onions and pork belly was our favorite, the sauce was sweet and delicious.<br><br>The Easy Rider burger was messy with its thick red BBQ sauce but with two thin slices of bacon I&#39;m not sure the menu description of &#39;bacon, and more bacon&#39; is really accurate!<br><br>Polish fries were by far the best part of the entire meal, huge portion of extra crispy tater sticks smothered in melted cheese, kielbasa and sauerkraut. Blue Cheese fries were good, we loved the super spicy sauce on them but wished the blue cheese chunks were smaller. <br><br>Its probably not near your house, but find a way to get there and check it out!	1
I&#39;m giving this place 4 stars with the caveat that they&#39;re new and I want them to succeed. But to echo the cons sentiment of another yelper:<br>1. Silverwear is confusing. Either have it rolled and out or direct people where to get it by putting up signs. <br>2. We arrived at open on a Sunday for brunch - chef wasn&#39;t there. He was getting supplies. I get it. The place is small and not big staff. But when you open - you had better be ready to serve food! <br>3. Food is delicious but for the price the portions are too small. Note to chef- the French toast is awesome but you have to serve 4 slices like any other neighborhood spot- especially when you&#39;re not including table service. <br><br>Pros<br>1. Nice upgrade to the hood. <br>2. Counter service means no tipping and no waiting on servers <br>3. Excellent concept and food is on the mark. <br><br>I know this guy will get his act together but I don&#39;t intend to go back for another month while he works his kinks out.	1
It angers me to be so hyped up about a place and then have to give them such a low grade rating. Overrated, overpriced and under serviced would be the top 3 ways I could describe it. I was so stoked to try the new raw bar, fresh antipasta made in front of you, outdoor seating with firepits restaurant the Hard Rock was offering. Not to mention menu choices like beef stroganoff, ribs, fried chicken, and meatloaf. I for sure thought I would be in heaven. <br>Now let me start with the 2 good things about this place.<br>1- The ambiance. It was a huge indoor/outdoor 2 bars, view of the pool. AMAZING set up. If you sit indoors, you can watch them make your antipasti platter fresh in front of you which brings me to the the highlight of the meal<br>2- THE ANITPASTI! So it was for sure over priced. $8 per cured meat. $5 per cheese. $4 per snack (snacks included olives peppers, bread, etc)<br>My super awesome platter cost $38. Sad that it was the only thing worth it. The meats were perfectly salted and the cheeses were imported. I would actually order this again if I wasn&#39;t worried about the cost. <br>Thats it. All the positives. <br>On to the reason for the 2 star rating. First and foremost the shitty service. Not only was our waiter unattentive and slow. He was careless. He didn&#39;t once offer to refill our empty glasses we had to ask. He didn&#39;t notice nor care that 1 of the 4 of us barley touched her food due to it being undercooked. (seriously meatloaf pink??) We also noted that our order was put in around 7:30, and we were patiently awaiting our check at 9:20. <br>Between us we had ribs that had jalapeno in the title, yet tasted sweet. 2 orders of undercooked meatloaf. And a steak. <br>The side items were decent, but even the taters that came with the meatloaf lacked consistency. <br>My boyfriend insisted we get dessert since all 4 of us were still hungry and there are not many places in town you can get freshly made monkey bread. Again a dissapointment. Small, and it took more like 20 minutes versus the 10 they claimed it to take. <br>Overall the bad food may have been a fluke. I could tell there was a potential for yummy-ness had they cooked the meatloaf another hour, added spice to the ribs, and a little love in their kitchen. On this trip they really lived up the the &#34;culinary dropout&#34; name and left a lot to be desired.	0
I really can&#39;t tell you how well the chicago dog was compared to others; it&#39;s the first I&#39;ve ever had. But I thought it was pretty good, even though the dog itself seemed kind of small. I guess that&#39;s just how they come. The toppings were plenty however, and the seasoned fries were delicious.<br>My favorite thing here has to be the italian beef sandwich, which comes mild or hot. Be careful, when they say hot, they mean hot, not that pussified wannabe spicy crap you get at most places. So, so good!	1
One star for our New Year&#39;s Eve reservation experience. We had used their online booking system and reserved a table for 4 at 10:15PM. Had confirmed w their email. The man and I had been a month earlier and been more than happy w our service and the flavors presented. We were very much looking forward to sharing this w close friends and bringing in the new year over small plates.<br><br>Unfortunately, we walked in at 10PM and were immediately approached by the hostess whose first and only words to us were &#34;sorry, we just closed&#34;. WHAT?! We mentioned our reservation was at 10:15PM made thru their system but were ignored. She then walked away from our party and for the next 5 minutes there was no one we could find to speak to. Standing there feeling like fools and very disappointed, we then yelp&#39;d for a nearby open restaurant and left.<br><br>Utter disappointment. Terrible response.	0
inexpensive good mexican food.... for a late night meal. 	0
Very small, cute, cozy restaurant. Hard to miss because of the blue light!<br><br>Food: 5/5. They serve small appetizer/tapas plates as well as full meals, some of which are in bento boxes! The beans were full of garlic and delicious; the purnil was a bit salty, but still packed with flavor. The arepas have a delicious sauce with them, I highly recommend them as an appetizer.<br><br>Service: generally great The staff is friendly and attentive: my glass of water was never low. I made a reservation beforehand, and they called 40 minutes beforehand to inform me that reservations were running behind and to show up half an hour later. <br><br>Overall, a great experience with fantastic food.	1
First observations: Came in with high expectations. Told them about reviews... They suggested I sit in the sushi bar to get better service.<br><br>Back door was open by the restroom. <br><br>Sake glasses had lipstick:((( <br><br>Sushi was tiny... Servers didn&#39;t have knowledge of menu and service. <br><br>I really don&#39;t know where all the good reviews are coming from...<br><br>Prompt at seating and also prompt a refilling water and drinks. <br><br>Final: I wouldn&#39;t even get a stamp card. What a disappointment.	0
ok so, i feel bad for giving this place a bad review because it is pretty new and maybe they just need to work out some kinks. i also think i ordered the wrong thing as well (the pork chop, which was fatty as hell). my pre-dinner cocktail (watermelon margarita) wasn't very good either. however, the mac & cheese was really good. it was my buddy's bday dinner that night and he got the halibut and said it was really good ... also, i hear their friend chicken is awesome. so maybe i'll give it one more shot at a later date. other pluses were the place had a good atmosphere inside ... well, besides the horrid artwork that was on the wall by our table. it's also in a terrible neighborhood, so if you're scared of crackheads, you may want to reconsider.	0
The best korean bbq in town! And the severs (especially June) treat us well and very friendly! Good job guys :)	1
might be an acquired taste, but the broth was super bland. maybe good if you&#39;re sick.. was really light. i added so much kimchi and rice to help it out until my bowl was pure red broth. very few thin slices of meat too. lots of green onions. don&#39;t really understand the hype. left a bit unfulfilled and disappointed<br><br>Ps i&#39;m use to japanese ramen, or chinese noodle soups...anything with more taste.<br><br>maybe this place is good for old people who like less sodium less oil, etc.	0
The guy who works here is amazing and very friendly. The food is delicious. I really enjoyed chicken tacos and burrito mojado. If you&#39;re in the neighbourhood, this place is definitely worth checking out.	1
Stumbled upon this place because it is like a block away from my house, and now I am a regular- at least 3-4 times a month. I overall like the food served here as well as the customer service. Love the original crispy chickens, they are the best and pretty good spicy rice cake too .It was just the right amount of spicy and just amazing.I did find a bit of inconsistency with one of the orders, which was the "honey bee chicken," the first time I tried it, I thought I was in love. But the second time I got it, it was less tasty and the sauce was not as rich. I hope the next time I order, it tastes like the first time :)	1
We were in Madison for a family funeral and took the extended family to Orient House for a very late lunch/early dinner. Not being familiar with the restaurants in the area, we used reviews from Yelp to choose this restaurant. When we arrived, there was no one in the restaurant and we were all afraid the good reviews had been misleading/inaccurate. But we were starving and even though there were two Japanese and a Peruvian restaurants right on the same street, we took our chances and walked through the door. It was the best dinning decision we've made in a long, long time.	0
Service amazing, food delicious - best Chinese I have had in America. Would definitely go again. The duck was the best.	1
I work at CHLA so we ordered take-out from here late night. The shakes were amazing! So rich and creamy, SO DELICIOUS!Mac and cheese balls were alright, not as much flavor as I would have liked.The spaghetti and turkey meatballs were surprisingly good. Turkey meatballs didn't seem enticing to me but good thing I went halvsies on them with my friend!Little bit pricey but it's pretty good food. Will have to try the Bossanova next time!	1
really bland brother there is nothing you do or add or fix the broth..........IPPUDO RAMEN YI JI BANG ! BUTTTTTTTTTTT the asparagus prosciutto is to die for :P	0
Great new spot in the neighborhood. I much prefer it to LM which used to be in this same spot. Cocktails were fantastic. Food was great. We didn&#39;t have a reservation, so we sat at the kitchen counter which I highly recommend.	1
Love the venue! Cute and classy decor. Great view of LA! I&#39;m a sucker for rooftops and nice views. <br><br>Made reservations for Sunday brunch with my girlfriends. One of my friends drank too much the night before and was running late. Pushed back the reservations an hour (no problem). Arrived and requested seating outside. Only a 10-15 min wait. Went to the rooftop bar to grab a drink while waiting. Highly recommend the Bloody Mary! <br><br>Seated and I ordered the steak frites. Steak was cooked perfect. Truffle fries were covered in a delicious cheese sauce. <br><br>While eating I found a small hair in my food. Told the waiter. He seemed confused? He picked up the plate and took it to the back, not really saying much. Wasn&#39;t sure if he even apologized? Then he came back, briefly apologized and said they were making me a new plate. Didn&#39;t expect the meal to be comped or anything but was expecting a little more than a puzzled look and meaningless apology? After that it took me awhile to flag him down and order a second drink. You think he would have checked up on us more after that incident.<br><br>Venue: 5 stars<br>Food: 4 stars<br>Service: -2 stars (1 for the hair &amp; 1 for the server)	0
Worst service ever. First thing, you can't expect much from a 24 hour diner anyways,but waitress that worked there on 7/8 was a complete b, excuse my language. First she got our order wrong. Second I didn't leave a tip and was in such a rush to get out of there I left my phone. Had no problem going back, but seeing as that I had not been anywhere else, but there, my car and my apartment that night and was texting while I was at the table it would not have magically disappeared. Well the waitress that was at our table and the cooks all couldn't find it. Didn't bother looking just said that hadn't seen the phone. So go here for diarrhea, which happened all next day and to get your stuff stolen by the help. I will tell everyone to go to Denny's or Norm's and the waitresses are thieves.	0
Given its long history and the hype that surrounds it, the apple pan falls very short. This place has a vintage charm to it, with only a counter inside. However, the burger falls flat.<br><br>Let&#39;s break it down:<br>- The patties are slightly overcooked and dry<br>- They slice off a hunk of lettuce and throw it in, and most bites are more lettuce-y then burger<br>- Bun was standard<br>- Fries were run of the mill, a little undersalted<br>- Tried the banana pie given the reviews... simply ordinary pie with banana slices rammed inside and not distributed throughout the pie. <br><br>We left with an empty feeling... hungry for a burger with strength. When it comes to LA burgers, go up the street to Five Guys or Umami instead.	0
I'm not impressed with this place. And I'm wondering why people are comparing this chain to Juicy Burger? I like the bar area, the bartender is nice, thanks to my beautiful friend, she captivates men. There was no french fries that time when I went, so I end up with the sweet potato. The burger is not that good really, the same thing with lucky devils. They are bland. I don't like bland food. It's expensive too. The place is dark inside and they got outside seating, that's the good part. It's hard to find parking. Some of my friends rave this place so I went, but I didn't find it that good. Thank you I have a good company so I enjoyed my time, but the food is worth 1 star + another 1 star for ambiance.	0
Every time we go here, I tell my dinnermates, This is the type of place I want to own some day.	0
I've been to Bloom several times, but today inspired me to finally write a review. The food is always creative, tasty, and fresh. I love the eggs benedict and the fact that we can bring our own champagne for mimosas. Today I tried the huevos rancheros which wasn't the typical Mexican style kind - that's fine, but it wasn't what I expected. I was kind of a diva and asked them to change the order, my waiter was super nice and didn't hesitate. I ended up ordering the lemon ricotta pancakes which were delish. I really appreciated the customer service today and how nice my waiter was. Thank you Bloom! This is one of my favorite neighborhood spots!	1
-Subtract 2 stars for boys being on one side of the roof and girls on the other-Subtract 3 stars for rooftop music befitting a graphic design studio in Latvia-Subtract 1 star for keystone cop doormen speaking into their shirt sleeves and fiddling nervously with their earpieces-Subtract 3 stars for bar-tending that has shot pretty far south of the mark on repeat visits-Add 5 stars for one of L.A.'s best rooftop views.Add it up and you get a one-star wish that this place will fold, and that a better-executed concept will move in.	0
We got there  earlier, our table wasnt ready yet but we didnt have to wait longer i will said 15 min. Food was delicious  our server  was super nice. I defently  go back.	1
My friends and I came here last Friday night, and I was really disappointed with the quality of food and the price. First things first, though, I will admit that we didn&#39;t order &#34;smartly:&#34; I got a fish dish, one of my friends got duck, and the other got the tagliatelle bolognese. <br><br>Here are my tips based on this experience: <br><br>1) DON&#39;T waste time and money on the appetizers. The bread and oil is quite good (not the best quality olive oil, but it&#39;s free so whatever), and the apps just weren&#39;t worth the money.<br><br>2) DON&#39;T order anything other than pasta, and have a backup plan in case they&#39;re sold out. I ordered gnocchi, but 15 minutes after I ordered the waiter came back to tell me that they had run out. I ended up ordering salmon trout which was so mediocre I got a burger from shake shack after we ate here. (Don&#39;t judge me, I have needs). <br><br>3) DO bring cash, and lots of it. <br><br>My friend&#39;s duck was very fatty, but the tagliatelle bolognese my other friend ordered was delicious. <br><br>I want to go back and try the gnocchi eventually, but I definitely will not order anything else on the menu.	0
I really love this place! Love the burgers, love everything in it! You can watch sport games and have a nice beer. The waiters are always very friendly. Great place to enjoy a nice burger with friends.	1
Have you ever wanted to travel back in time? Well one step into this place and you&#39;ll feel you&#39;ve been transported back to the early 1920s.<br><br>With only counter space surrounding the kitchen area for you to sit, make sure you go here expecting to wait or expecting to be sitting in separate groups (if you came in a big group of people). The walls are covered with plaid wall paper, popular in a time when telephones were newfangled modes of communication. Speaking of newfangled, their register is right out of the teens of the past century, with wooden buttons and a bell that rings the moment it opens. Classic.<br><br>The menu is short and sweet with no more than 10 items on the entire thing. Order a burger, either hickory or some other kind I can&#39;t recall, with cheese or not. That&#39;s about it. Side of fries with that? Sweet potato or regular? A milk shake, root beer or some other soda? Maybe you&#39;ll finish it off with one of their delicious pies, though there are only three to choose from so pick carefully. Notice that the menu gives you the dates of inception of the recipes from the burgers to the pies. You&#39;ll be amazed that it still stands up a century, literally a century, later.<br><br>Don&#39;t let the simplicity of this place fool you. The burgers are as good as gourmet with an almost sweet taste that melts in your mouth. Add whatever kind of &#34;sauce&#34; you like to it to give it that extra kick. While you may feel you&#39;ve entered into a time warp your mouth will feel like it&#39;s been elevated to heaven with each passing bite of whatever you have in front of you. You&#39;ll feel so full by the end you&#39;ll wonder how anyone went hungry back in the day. <br><br>Walk back outside with the cars whooshing past and you&#39;ll know you&#39;ve returned to the 21st century but your mouth and belly will be reminiscing for a more simple time.	1
Small place. Really slow. We ordered an appetizer but did not get it till after we asked for the bill. We had dinner and still no app. The food portions are really small as well. The only good pleasant things were the Sapporo and the mushroom garlic fried rice. Not returning	0
This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Seattle! Next time you want authentic Chinese food venture out of the Int'l District and come here. I have eaten here several times now and have yet to be disappointed! If their awesome noodles are not your thing ask for suggestions the staff is always ready to recommend something tasty. I will be coming back here often!	1
From rice to dishes.. Very disappointed experience	0
Whiz feeds you, when you don't have the motherfucking gumption to feed yourself. Go play hard mother trucker. Polychronopolous.	1
I usually don&#39;t post reviews but I enjoyed the food so much that I just had to tell you about it. I had the chicken with rice and beans. The chicken was soooo tasty, the beans were awesome. They brought us bread w butter when we first sat down. Then with the meal they also brought plantain chips - not greasy at all. The fried boniato was excellent- not greasy. My husband had the pork chunks- also v tasty. Service was great and friendly. Wish they would have had decaf coffee though and maybe more dessert choices.	1
We have certain expectations for friendly service. Those expectations were not met. We&#39;d heard this place had a decent burger. We came in, 6pm empty restaurant, asked for table for 2, the hostess just wasn&#39;t friendly, in need of attitude adjustment for service business. She said &#34;Well we have QUITE a few reservations but we&#39;ll SEE what we can do.&#34; Um don&#39;t do us no favors, young lady! This isn&#39;t The French Laundry. It&#39;s January and it was pouring rain, and we were soaked even with our umbrellas after a cool Patrick Wilson sighting at Brooklyn Industries down the block. Hostess came back and pointed to the two tables directly in front of the door. It&#39;s January. It&#39;s cold. We&#39;re wet. Just a classic obnoxious restaurant thing to do to offer us the two worst tables in the restaurant. We offered to sit at the bar but the bartender seemed overwhelmed, spritzing seltzer into several drinks in increments over a few minutes. We peaced out and walked over to Mrs. Kim&#39;s who knocked it out of the park with sick fried chicken and these rice cakes that were a delight. Go to Mrs. Kim&#39;s everyone! Next to Vamos on Franklin. Very chill environment over there and excellent Korean fusion.	0
The best peanut butter cookie EVER!	1
Diablo I wonder why you are not always busy! Do you think its due to lack of service at your bar?I like the idea of a popsicle in your mug when ordering a michelada, however, waiting for it to melt so you can get all the flavors is really lame.I have yet to come for another try, maybe then I will add another star.	0
the food is awesome!	1
I love the original Oinkster in Eagle Rock, and was thrilled to hear about the new one opening in Hollywood. I went for lunch recently, and I liked this location at least as much as the original.The space is modern and handsomely decorated, with a brighter, trendier feel than the Eagle Rock spot. The atmosphere is still homey and casual, though, and the place delivers the slow fast food experience that put The Oinkster on the map. You order at the counter, take a number, and seat yourself. Your food comes to you, and you can help yourself to the plentiful condiments. Service is friendly, and I like the patio seating, which is dog-friendly.I abstained from beer on this particular outing, but The Oinkster has some good ones on tap. I also like the thick, creamy milk shakes, the purple ube being an Oinkster classic.The food is great. I got an Oinkster pastrami, which is what I get about two out of three visits to The Oinkster. The pastrami is house-cured and very flavorful, with thin slices stacked high--more fast food-style than, say, Langer's pastrami, but delicious in its own right. You can get it plain, but I like the Oinkster version with red cabbage coleslaw, caramelized onions, and gruyere cheese, with a pickle spear on the side. The bread can't quite handle it all, so it does get soggy sometimes, letting the sandwich fall apart. Doesn't really bother me, though. I like my pastrami with deli mustard (though sometimes I have a hard time choosing from the various mustard options) and the mixed pickles at the condiment bar, the spicy peppers in particular. I also enjoy the pulled pork sandwich, though I haven't had it here. The fries, though--they're hand-cut Belgian double-fried fries, but I can't seem to like them very much. They always come out pale yellow and unimpressive, though I do love the garlic aioli that comes on the side. Ditto the chipotle ketchup.In any case, I'm a big fan of this place. The Oinkster unites quality with ease, offering satisfying food in a very pleasant environment. I have to come back for more.	1
Kind of surprised with the negative reviews here, as I've had reliably good experiences with Smoky's. They serve very nice steaks and their prices are quite reasonable compared to your a la carte type steakhouses. A steak includes salad, soup and side all for one price. They don't exactly season the meat all that much so if you're looking for a salt crust on your sirloin then you will be disappointed, but I don't mind having to use the salt & pepper shakers a tad. You can always add salt, but there's no fixing too much of it. Besides, there's plenty of salt to be had in the hash brown, which is by far the best side dish option as long as you're not counting calories. Overall, a good option if you want a good steak with not a lot of fuss and a reasonable price compared to say, Tornado Club.	0
I love the fact that their menu is 90% gluten free, that alone deserves five stars. I came in on a Saturday around 4:30pm and it was pretty slow which was perfect since I heard it can get busy. The atmosphere is super cute, the restaurant is very small (you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the restroom- but I like seeing the kitchens!) and the service was friendly, but not in an in your face kind of way which I can appreciate. As for the food, we had chips and guacamole/salsa, crispy beef &amp; pickle tacos, lobster tacos, elote and the carne asada tacos. <br><br>-Chips &amp; Guacamole/Salsa: AMAZING!!!! The chips are fresh with the perfect amount of salt and the guacamole was delicious. The salsa was a bit spicy for me, but the taste was good.<br>-Crispy Beef Taco &amp; Pickle: Whoa! The combo might seem weird but it was SO good! The sharpness of the cheddar with the tangy pickle and the yummy beef was perfect. <br>-Lobster Taco: I was most excited to try this taco, but was slightly disappointed. The lobster is fresh and quite good, there was a little too much slaw for me and I didn&#39;t taste the crema at all, just a lot of lime. For $19 it wasn&#39;t worth it.<br>-Carne Asada Taco: DELISH! I loved the chunky avocado on this taco, it just completed the whole thing.<br>-Elote: I was let down on this one. The corn was tasteless and mushy, it didn&#39;t seem fresh at all and again, it was all lime. <br><br>Their menu is great for sharing, you get two tacos in each order. I really liked this place and despite the lobster taco and elote, I loved everything.	1
This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to. I went with 3 girlfriends and we were literally yelling at each other at the table. Something about the way the place was built makes the noise bounce back and forth, so it&#39;s very loud in there. The service was terrible. Took 20 min to get a sample of a beer then another 20 for the glass. They sent us the wrong food 2x. Lastly, the food is extremely over priced for 2 reasons: 1. Doesn&#39;t taste good and 2. Bad quality. For example, the mashed potatoes were $6 for a bowl and they were instant (from a box)!!	0
This is the kind of diner/restaurant you want to know about so you can take people there and then they think you know what your doing.. Cute waitresses, great food... AND 365 days / 24-7? Love it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE and the Cheese balls.	1
Haven't tried the restaurant yet, but their deli sandwiches are terrific.	1
Order the 'bool dalk' and your choice of beer. Fire chicken is the literal translation of bool dalk. You can request your own level of spiciness to your comfort or for the challenge. I've tried a not-too-spicy bool dalk with cheese and it was delicious. Crank up the heat. It's deliciously on fiyaaah!	1
I came here tonight for the first time and I loved it! Everything seems so delicious and what I ordered most certainly was delicious! The vibe of this place is cool as well. I like it all and recommend the corn for sure!	1
Real cold meat-a-balls.Real cold staff, no follow up.But Monday supper!	0
The service was great, the atmosphere was great- besides that, the only thing that I truly enjoyed was the chicken in a soy broth. The oysters were not clean or fresh, the cauliflower soup had no flavor, so on and so forth. It was overpriced, definitely not worth what you are getting. I was very disappointed.	0
Only time I write reviews is when it's really good or really bad. I had zero expectation but it was super delish! We had breezy bacon Burger and curry wings. Everything was very good. This will be my top go-to place in my neighborhood.	1
Food was ok. Not great but not horrible. Had the chicken quesadilla with corn flour. Was more like tacos with cheese warmed up. My friend has the pollo adobo. It was just ok. Woman serving us was nice though. Would probably not come back to eat here.	0
Ordered from this place via EAT24, was told the delivery will take 45 min (the restaurant is about 5 min away from my place). After waiting for 1 hour and 20 min I contacted EAT24 and was told the restaurant apologizes for the delay and my food will be delivered in a few minutes. Waited. At about 2 hour mark i reached out to EAT24 again and was told that restaurant misplaced my order and that kitchen is closed already and there is nothing they can do. Thanks, My Ceviche!	0
Such a cute place with nice views and plenty of room in the patio. Make sure to take a heavy jacket for your companion ;)	1
On the pricier side of what I&#39;d call a &#34;casual&#34; dinner, and right in line with the slue of New American restaurants popping up in downtown and Silverlake and the other up and coming hip places. <br><br>I went with a gal pal of mine last night because I&#39;d heard good things about this new spot (it&#39;s new-ish, right?) and other than wishing I could get a slightly cheaper glass of wine (not over priced overall, but my unrefined palate would have appreciated more in the $7-10 range instead of the $12-17 range) I was totally satisfied with our meal. I tend to go to nicer places and stick to small plates to keep with my budget instead of going to lower-priced places in general, which was an awesome strategy here - a flatbread, a starter, and a vegetable dish were more than enough to feed the two of us. I ended up taking leftovers home! <br><br>We had the leek, stilton, and truffle oil flatbread which was definitely truffle-y; it was very good, though I think I would have preferred to stuck to my instinct and gone with the prosciutto and arugula one, just some less bold flavors there makes it more palatable in larger quantities. We also ordered the veal meatballs with romesco and yogurt mint sauce which were delicious, and the brussel sprouts with pancetta and a fried egg, a staple on winter New American menus it seems, and it didn&#39;t disappoint. I always love a good brussel and these were very well caramelized. <br><br>Wait staff was friendly, and the abmiance was hip and dark without being overly intimate - I could easily see going here for a real date night just as much as a friend-date night. And I was there for dinner, not late night, but I would imagine it&#39;s very well suited for midnight munchies! Or at least more european style 10pm dining.	1
i&#39;m sorry to say but this isn&#39;t the best Ramen Noodle i&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>First the line/wait is long <br>Second the place is small<br>3rd the food was just &#34;OKAY AVERAGE&#34; I will not wait for a freakin Ramen for one hour, it is not worth it, I rather go somewhere else that is shorter. There is this one place that is pretty good but i forgot the name of it hahha. I don&#39;t see why people will wait in the line for this long just for a freakin ramen. Its just too ridiculous and too much. <br><br>I&#39;m rating this one star because of the wait, if the wait doesn&#39;t have to be long i will rate it 5 star.	0
Our Paseo experience begins on a Monday. Dont come on a Monday, they will not be open. We try again on Tuesday, around 11:30 and there is already a line out the door. 15 minutes later we place our order and about 15 minutes after that we receive the two juiciest, messiest, most flavorful sandwiches in Seattle. Sandwiches live up to the hype, so did the wait. You decide if its worth it.	0
Ate here on my first night in Seattle and I don't know if that was a mistake or not because it set the bar pretty high. Loved the atmosphere. We sat outside on a mid-september night when the weather was perfect and clear enough to see the water and the ferries going back and forth. The food was all fantastic. We split the prosciutto plate..obviously it's hard to mess that up so no complaints there. I ordered the spaghetti bolognese and my boyfriend ordered the summer risotto. Both were fantastic and we ended up sharing everything except the wine. I like a lighter red (had the Oregon Pinot Noir) and my boyfriend likes a Cab so I loved that they had half bottles which we each ordered in our preferred varietal. I can't speak highly enough of the risotto though. It really was so perfect. It had summer corn and dungeness crab. The flavor was so so good and I'm still dreaming about it. Also had the Carmel Budino for dessert and I have to say it was quite sweet but it really was deicious. My boyfriend was obsessed. Oh yeah, and the outdoor tablecloths were so cute...I just loved that touch.	1
WTF happened to this place?? Why did they get rid of galbi and banchan??? Why the fawk are they bringing some random tacos and ramen now???!!!! Who made this dumb change? Also- why are the servers so damn unhappy with their lives? They're so pist off and annoyed all the time. Goodbye KogiKing. I used to love you but now I'm never coming back.	0
It&#39;s mothers day and we head for a quick bite cuz I don&#39;t want to cook. We opt for Cuban food as we don&#39;t want to wait eternities else where. This place did not have a waiting line so we tried it out. We get the croqueta preparada, pan con bistec and steak with Moro. The usual garlic bread was provided with our drinks. The food was average, not something I would go out of my way for. Now, service was horrible... Our server/ waitress disappeared into thin air... No water/ soda refills and we had to get ketchup from a nearby table! And the placed was not even packed! Now I know why.... I&#39;m not coming back...	0
It&#39;s going to be really hard to write this review, the rating is not because of the food or drinks, those were really good. But I do appreciate when a good manager keeps the staff in checked.<br><br>When we got there we were told that the pitcher of sangria was $10 in happy hour. We order 2 pitchers before 7pm, among several plates. When it was time to pay the bill, our surprise was seeing the pitchers at full price. And when I asked about it the waiter tells me that the one at that price is the half pitcher. At this point all I wanted to do is talk to the manager, and the waiter in a very rude manner approached us, and claiming that it was a misunderstanding and miscommunication grabbed the bill (which was handwritten) and tore it right there in front of us. As I see things, if it was a mistake (totally posible) I would have fix the pitcher value as a way to say sorry and let the customer pay the bill. At this point with no bill I couldn&#39;t pay it, couldn&#39;t talk to the manager and no tip for the waiter of course after that behavior.<br><br>It seems very dubious to me and my friends that this guys destroyed the bill without trying to come up with another solution and talk about it. I consider myself a very understanding costumer but I don&#39;t answer good to rudeness and when I feel some type of dishonesty is happening I can&#39;t let it go.<br>Hopefully this was a one person thing and I had bad luck.	0
Definitely a great meal of steak and frites for dineLA but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d pay $25 per person for this on the regular.<br><br>The restaurant is very, very pretty. It&#39;s classy and perfect for a date if you are a classy person. The couple next to us was actually on a birthday date. They some classy folk cuz for my birthday I ate chips in the car while driving my boyfriend to my &#34;surprise&#34;...yeah, he has his license, he just doesn&#39;t like to drive -___-<br><br>Anyway! L&#39;Assiette is really nice, and the dineLA dinner was one of my favorites. YOU HAVE TO GET THE SOUP TO START!!!! please! Like the name &#34;sorrel herb soup&#34; sounded to my uncultured ears like some plain old brothy vegetable soup, but no! It&#39;s creamy and delicious and sort of like a smooth vegetable chowder...I don&#39;t know, it was definitely a great surprise because I wasn&#39;t expecting much from the appetizers. The salad is fine, I guess, but you can have the same old balsamic vinaigrette salad ANYWHERE, but not that tasty soup :)<br><br>The steak and frites entree was delicious. The fries cooked in beef tallow were so delicious and crispy, and the gravy/sauce that the beef was cooked in made the meal. We asked for extra sauce to dip our fries in because we lack both class and shame, and it was worth it! GET EXTRA SAUCE!!<br><br>The downside of the meal: So since we get 2 courses of each entree, my boyfriend and I got the steak and frites, and then we decided why not, let&#39;s try the portobello mushroom with vegetarian fries. Oh no. DO NOT GET THE VEGETARIAN PEANUT OIL FRIES. WOAHHHHH they were so soggy and undercooked, ew. EVERY single fry was mushy and bent, like it was to the point where if you held one up, it would not be straight because it was just undercooked. I was super disappointed here, because DUDE, you are a steak and frites restaurant, what&#39;s going on with these frites? Like it&#39;s not like fries cooked in oil have to be shitty....EVERYWHERE else cooks fries in vegetable oil and they can make it crispy! Why can&#39;t you??<br><br>So, I asked them to please make the peanut oil fries crispier for the second course. They said, &#34;Of course!&#34; but they didn&#39;t, it was just as disappointing the second time around :(<br><br>But not all is lost! Because the medium rare steak was beautiful and tender, and the desserts were great as well. I really liked the amaretto cake because it was so moist and it was served on a plate of delicious cream. The fudge brownie was not as dense or moist as I would have liked :( It was kinda dry and cake-y. The rose macaron they served with it was disgusting....I just hate floral flavors. It&#39;s upsetting to me. I don&#39;t enjoy eating soap. My soaps mostly smell like food also. I just, no.<br><br>Overall, I had a good time! haha sorry for my UP and down writing, somethings were good and some were bad and I tend to get caught up in the emotion, but it was definitely a good experience! I left L&#39;Assiette with a comfortable feeling in my stomach, a couple of extra inches around my waist, and a smile on my face :)	1
Considering how busy the Bazaar was when I visited the stall, service was so quick, and staff were very friendly and efficient. I had the Super Frite with curry ketchup and they were absolutely to die for. I&#39;ve tried French fries at plenty of places around the city, but these were easily some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Hot, crispy, perfectly salted, and freshly prepared. Couldn&#39;t ask for anything better.	1
Delicious a bit pricey but you get lots of food 	1
Broth was great, but I&#39;ve had better noodles. They were hard and not chewy enough.	0
Was excited to try this place because of all the great yelp reviews. My G. Friend and I Have been eating K. BBQ for years now, so we where not new to the food or environment. Sadly , food was tasty and good going in, but we both had major stomach issues all that night and the next day. Needless to say, we will not be returning. Not a great Saturday date night experiance.	0
Just WOW. The food here is HORRIBLE. The service is horrendous. Save your money and your health. The sandwiches here are overpriced and filled with bad ingredients. The quality of the meat is old and dry, doesn't even smell like meat. One time I got more fat than meat in my sandwich. The bread is always soggy. The last time I ordered my food came with peanuts on it!!! I specifically told them I was allergic!!! This is due to their extreme negligence for their customers because they don't care. The soups here are nasty also and super over priced!! Don't touch this place you will regret it. Also they take over an HOUR to deliver food 5 minutes away!!!	0
Went for a weekend lunch for my first trip. Nice beer selection, but a bit pricey relative to other local prices. E.g., $7 for a pint of beer that would go for $5-6 at other comparable establishments like Alchemy or Brasserie V. I would expect that in Chicago but not Madison.	0
We stumbled on this place while looking for somewhere to sit down and enjoy a drink and a bite to eat (No easy feat in Williamsburg on a rainy Friday night) and we&#39;re so glad we did! It was just the right level of busy, a buzz but a couple of free tables. The cocktails ($10 each) were delicious, and the italian influenced food was awesome - the porchetta in particular. Perfect for a date, we&#39;ll be back!	1
Great place to go for a drink in the evening. Stopped in on Halloween eve, and it was rather empty. Went to the bar, ordered drinks, and sat down on one of the chairs outside. Was warmish thanks to the patio heaters they have spread out all around the tables. The view was nice, kinda makes you feel like you're out of the city. Someone mentioned loud music, and I personally liked that as it removed ambient noise from the outside which made it feel even more like "getting away".I live down the block, so I will probably be checking out this spot for a little while, until it starts to get more popular... and most probably harder to get into (or a table).Staff was on par, always there to fill water and ask if we were fine. Maybe a bit "over-staffed" that particular night? Who knows, lots of servers/waitresses running around. There is also a fire pit further down (past the pool), did not make it down there. But it looked like a good place to warm up these cold nights.We did not order much food, just a desert and some fries, both were good. May come back here for dinner and update. I was really impressed with this spot, and recommend checking it out if you're in the area. This side of town isn't the hottest spot, but like many other people are saying, Wilshire is up-and-coming. So who knows, may be a hot spot very soon.Just one note... there are only two bathrooms upstairs on the rooftop. One stall for men, and one for women. The bathroom is nicely designed, but the sinks are damn tiny. I can see there be a waiting line for the bathrooms, unless there are some directly downstairs for customers to use (non-guests).Will be back...	1
PRO: Great Beer. CONS:Pushy service. I felt as if I did not order something else the server was going to hit me. TOO MUCH SALT! I definitely like salt, but the cured fish plate seemed like they A) forgot to wash the curing salts off the fish B) spilled the salt all over the chip the salmon was served on. The fries and fish plates together were so salty that it ruined the best part of the meal which was the beer. After the two plates I was still hungry for more food, but decided that my date and I would get a main course and dessert elsewhere.I really wanted to love this place and I could write a much more witty and well documented version of my accounts, but my mouth is still dry from the salt and I need to get up and grab a glass of water.	0
A very welcome addition to the neighborhood! This is a very comfortable, friendly and affordable bistro that leans in a decidedly Mediterranean direction (fresh fish, lamb - served as koffte kebabs or as a tender and generous lamb shank) while still serving the expected staples of roast chicken, hamburgers, et al. Everything I sampled was carefully prepared, fresh as could be, and served with sincere warmth and hospitality. What a pleasure.	1
What a disappointment. The service was uneven, the drinks weak, but expensive and the food had no flavor. We ordered my son macaroni and cheese, which included Tillamook diner cheese- not soulful at all. He didn't even finish it. The best thing on the table was the glass of malbec they pour. To be honest, I don't even recall what I ordered, the food was so forgetful. I won't be back.	0
2 Stars.. We came here last night after watching Beck and Jenny Lewis play at Club Nokia.. I have past by this cafe so many times in the past and I have always wanted to try it out.. Alas we did and I was not impressed at all.. <br><br>The wait was long and I was a little hungry for I had skipped dinner and had not eaten since lunch.. Some twelve hours earlier. So, finally we are seated. Miguel was our server and he was on top of it. He alone gets 5 stars. <br><br>The menu is pretty simple. You look on the wall and that&#39;s it. I ordered the scrambled eggs meal and coffee.. The bread that comes out before your meal was great.... BUT MY EGGS.. YUCK...... Overly greasy and seriously if you are taking ALLI I would recommend not taking it if you come here. You seriously will have an explosive mess... This really is a greasy dive sort of a place.... If you give two fucks about your figure then just know that this is not for you. My eggs were soaked in grease. I couldn&#39;t eat them.... <br><br>On a positive note... This place certainly has it&#39;s history and it&#39;s charm. It&#39;s been open for 88 years now... I wonder how many clogged arteries has this place given now... Any-hoot I tried it and I won&#39;t be back..<br><br>OH.. AND FOR THE CRAP THAT WE ATE CAME OUT OT BE A TOTAL OF $35 AND SOME CHANGE.... Over priced for crap I think...<br><br>Fin	0
Dear Paseo,	1
I really like this place, I&#39;ve had lunch here twice. I judge a Mexican restaurant by their salsa and the salsa here is great. Service was great and the decor is cute. I highly recommend this place	1
a ramen restaurant in seattle that is worth it. the shio broth is just as creamy as you'll find at the BC location - this is my dream ramen. it's incredibly rich. so worth it. glad it's finally in my backyard.	1
My husband and I gave it a shot yesterday and it is nothing special. I ordered the Homeskillet hamburger cooked well done. The menu explains that it comes with American Cheese. When it came out it did not have cheese so I took it back up. The girl said, "Oh, what kind of cheese did you want?" Well your menu says American so I am pretty sure that is what I wanted. Then I got 1/2 way through my burger and it was completely pink. Turns out that they cooked my husband's hamburger well done. I will not be back and wish I could get my $23 back.	0
This place is amazing. I've never been to a restaurant for breakfast on a weekday that was so packed, and I know why. Monday through Friday dishes are discounted! My friend had the bananas foster pancakes-they were unbelievable. I had the spicy shrimp with creamy grits and eggs (poached)-they were the best grits I've ever eaten. The cocktails were fantastic and the restaurant was beautiful! When I go back go Seattle, I WILL be going back.	0
Very yummy burgers. . they are not that large in size, but they fill you up. . the patty is thick. I had the truffle burger, DELICIOUS. the sweet potato fries were good too!!	1
It&#39;s so close to my place that we end up there fairly often. The foot is great, for the most part. Tried a few things that&#39;ve been duds, but the winners are as follows:<br><br>Mac &amp; cheese: Outstanding. Baked. Get it with ham &amp; broccoli. So good.<br>Hawaiian tuna poke with wonton chips: Awesome, and this is coming from someone who is not that down with sushi. <br>Blue crab hush puppies: Outstanding as well. Almost too much breading, but let&#39;s be frank, does such a thing exist? Negative ghost rider, the pattern is full.<br>Caesar salad: was outstanding because it was spicy, but they&#39;ve changed it. It is still good, just not as good as before.<br>El camarone pizza: Awesome, brings a lot of great tastes together into one happy-happy pizza.<br>Tasty burger: God DAMN this is good. The beef is amazing.<br>Flat iron steak: My favorite thing here. Steak is always great tasting, the green stuff they put on top is so good (god knows what it is...).<br><br>The only thing that keeps me from a five star review is the ambience on the place. <br><br>First off, and everyone who has been there knows this, it is just too damned dark. I understand you are trying to create a &#34;mood&#34; here folks, but your crappy orange candles are not sufficient light for me to read your menu. I have to literally bring it to within 2-3 inches of my face sometimes. Annoying. <br><br>The music. I know you can&#39;t please everyone, and lord knows you won&#39;t please me, but please refrain from EVER playing that shitty house music that sometimes comes on. I don&#39;t want to eat while I feel like I&#39;m in The Matrix. And the volume is always just 2 or 3dB too loud. I don&#39;t like having to raise my voice halfway to a shout to talk to my friends. And no, I&#39;m not old. F you!<br><br>The last thing they need to get rid of is the crappy new school art on the walls. New school has it&#39;s place, and that for me is usually graffitied onto buildings and overpasses. Not the walls of your restaurant. Change it please, kthxbai.	1
why is this place so expensive??? why must i pay for chips and salsa?? what has california mexican cuisine come to? i don't understand!! I don't think "good" mexican food can be categorized by how much you're paying for it...if so, this place would be the bees knees! but, I've had better.save a trip -- go to leo's on venice and la brea! $1 a taco!	0
we had a great time. the show and presentation of food is great. nothing else like it! our server was fantastic. he was bubbly, friendly and super accommodating. The food is good... not the best in LA but good. I would recommend going for special occasions.	1
We went earlier this year, the food wasn&#39;t very good. We ordered xiao long bao and shrimp with walnuts. I didn&#39;t like the soup in the buns, it tasted a little off. The shrimp was greasy and rubbery, the worst I&#39;ve ever had. To top it off, service was extremely slow for a completely empty restaurant.	0
This is hands down the BEST Thai Food I've ever had in my life. I could eat this every day. Every item I ordered was exquisite. 10 out of 10.	1
After i bought a pitcher of beer, the hostess made me leave my spot and the bar because they had people wanting to eat dinner. Im sorry but, everyone in my party ordered dinner, just because i just ordered alcohol and not food, doesnt make me a lesser person, i should not have to leave your mediocre italian meatball place because of something like this. But whatever its fine, (just talk to your staff in LES, and help them treat people better)	0
great sandwiches. on wood.	1
Order off the authentic menu.	1
THE MOO IS AWESOME. moooooooooo :Danyways tried the sampler today, i think it was AMAZING.eventhough the chicken strips looked like it had zits on it it was amzing especially with the honey mustard sauce. perfect combination.honey chicken was not super sweet like other places so its definitely a plus cause i can still taste the chicken unlike other places where it would seem as if its honey on bone.moooooooooo :Dcustomer service is on point, im a server so im highly critical about service. :D	1
We didn't get to eat. The cigar smell is so overpowering that we turned right around. We were going to try the patio but the cigar smell from inside is so strong that we couldn't take that either. Too bad as we were excited to discover nearby Cuban food.	0
Luna Park did a bang-up job for my birthday. Worked with me to create a menu, accommodated a large party without a snag, provided great service during the actual party, offered a range of nice cocktails -- and, oh yea, the food was great!This place has a nice vibe, great food, and excellent staff -- three cheers!NB: Their wine list is fairly priced and well chosen.	1
The manager here was super nice and super helpful along with the servers.. The manager Ashley was so nice! We ordered the Tempura Onion rings, truffled fries, original burger and pastrami mami burger.. Everything was very delicious. Our onion rings came out really late but Ashley not only took the onion rings off of our bill but also bought us a Bloody Mary! Kalynda was our server and she was also nice and helpful, she never left our side! Thank you umami burger! You guys are the shiizzzz	1
OK, OK, OK, Johny formerly of Pucci&#39;s and Little Louie&#39;s, has gone solo! It seems like I would follow this man anywhere, to experience his cooking. This New York transplant who really know how to spin a pizza, finally has his very own location and the menu is huge! Pizza superb, lasagna divine, great garlic rolls, etc., all served with a unique sense of humor! Johny has a customer service personality that can&#39;t be beat! One visit and you will be hooked! Give this real Italian Chief a try...	1
Not all it&#39;s cracked up to be. It is fun, I will give it that. I gave a few tries but now I&#39;m over it and prob not going back anytime soon.	0
Awesome hot dog stand in the middle of down town. If you are down town jumping from one joint to another this is a great spot to get a cheap snack if you&#39;re hungry? My favorite topping was definitely the crumbled potato chips.. Absolutely genius, who knew adding potato chips to a hot dog could add so much texture/crunch, flavor and all that jazz. The guy working the stand is pretty quick and friendly. Although I was a fan, Ryan M. was not but maybe that&#39;s because he&#39;s from Jersey?	1
Came here for brunch, got a strawberry, banana and nutella crepe. It was amazing! They had other stuff, both sweet and savory. Coffee was really good too. Service was e excellent, very friendly. They have a great neighborhood vibe. It was also really nice we didn&#39;t have to wait in a line for a hour and half to eat. Prices were great too!	1
The Zig Zag really has the BEST cocktails...went there with some friends and we all loved the specialty cocktails we chose. The atmosphere is fun too. Food was just average but that was okay this is a special and fun place.	1
I love this place. Their food &amp; coffee is awesome.<br><br>Would have given the place 5 stars if not for a couple things.<br>1. They need to get fly nets for the baked goods. People don&#39;t want to buy pastries after a fly has landed on it. Yuck.<br>2. I&#39;ve witnessed some unclean practices by a certain male employee. Namely, he put his fingers in a to go order he packaged for me. A day later, I saw his push down garbage in a garbage can with a rag he used to wipe down the counters with. <br><br>I hope management takes these mistakes seriously, it&#39;s just plain gross.	1
Craving pizza, wraps, chicken wings, and chocolate chip cookies, but worried about the fat? Worry no more- Power Pizza is the place for you! <br><br>Delicious pizzas with low-fat toppings and extra protein in the crust. <br><br>A large selection of yummy wraps, some come hot, some come cold, but all good! I especially recommend the chicken bacon ranch wrap or the spinach wrap (just had one now for lunch and it was so YUMMY--chicken, spinach, walnuts, red onion, bleu cheese and their own vinaigrette!). <br><br>Chicken Wings here are fantastic too! They are completely baked so no worries ab the oil vat fat! <br><br>Chocolate chip cookies are INSANELY good here. Truth be told, I am not 100% sure they aren&#39;t fattening, but I don&#39;t care! lol. They remind me a little of David&#39;s Cookies from back in the day inside the Dadeland Burdines, but I digress.... <br><br>They also have very good salads and I have heard good things about their Strombolis...haven&#39;t had a Stromboli there though...yet! <br><br>This is definitely the place to be if you want to eat &#34;fatty food&#34; and not feel as if you have to run 10 miles after!	1
I love this place. The attmosphere is a fun laid back restaurant. I always get the smores when I come here for dessert. Here is a rating of what I've had: Cheese Fondue: 8/10Hushpuppies: 6/10Margaritta Pizza: 7/10Mushroom Pizza: 7/10Your a Pepper Drink: 10/10Smores: 10/10Great attmosphere here. Some people come dressed up, some dont, and nobody cares. Love that kind of vibe.	1
Yumm! Whenever I&#39;m in the area you can find me eating lunch here. Chefs Kitchen is great for lunch and dinner Mon-Fri and they cater events and party&#39;s on weekends. This is a family owned business and Chef Hector is very talented. He studied at the Culinary Institute of America in New York and he is always in the know about all the best restaurants. I am never disappointed with his food. The menu changes everyday so you will never get bored eating there everyday. I usually substitute the regular vegi medley and mashed potatoes for his sauteed spinach and scalloped potatoes. If you like salad the Asian salad is wonderful. I find myself getting the chicken special or the fish. I love the way he prepares sea bass. Oh and his Chicken with roasted pears and Gorgonzola is to die for!	1
I liked the whole feel of the bar, came the 2nd night they were open which was a Saturday and it was pretty empty.They played indie-type music and it felt like one was in a big log cabin.I want to come back to try their food especially the Belgian waffles/fries.	1
sigh. i wanted to love this place. the two stars is mostly for the ambiance which is great. i really love the oaks gourmet and was hoping the same quality would be replicated here. the menu is ambitious, full of things that you should not have on the menu unless you are really going to nail them (i.e. po boys and philly cheese steaks) but they don't nail them, so them menu ends up being a hodge podge of poorly executed dishes. to top is all off the servers here are clueless. they don't know anything about the menu and can't steer you around it at all, whether it's food or beer or anything else. also, we were in there when it wasn't that busy and our server was looking around the place like she was slammed when there were other servers on the floor and plenty of bussers helping out. and why are you a pub with a bbq menu? just don't do a bbq menu unless it is going to be truly amazing bbq. they are just trying to do too many things here and doing none of them well.	0
I've been to LA Cafe dozens of times. They never fail to underwhelm me with their food. I go back again and again because of the location and the fact that they have alfresco seating. I love watching people go by and hanging out on the fake grass.But literally everything I've ever had has been mediocre.Get the food quality together guys. Mealy tomatoes, cold soup, and slow service? Get out of here. I could carry on about it for awhile, but this place is borderline 0-1 star material. I'm not coming back unless it's the middle of the night and I'm starving.	0
Food was GREAT. Service was GREAT. Value was GREAT. Portions were HUGE. What else can you say? It was the PERFECT place to stop for a GREAT meal in Chinatown. The reviews were not wrong. Stop by and you will be glad you did.	1
Fuel is everything a neighborhood coffee shop should be and it's in a great spot. The people who work there are all great and I've always felt right at home. Try the vegan brownies.	1
Good and fast, pricy though.<br>Came in for something small, just ordered a grilled cheese with bacon. I wanted the bacon inside, but the waiter thought I just wanted a side of it. Whatever, I just opened up my grilled cheese and put it inside. I sat at the bar so I was able to watch the cook, he was super fast, but had already made bacon sitting underneath the grill. He made my grilled cheese with only 4 slices and then I got served the sitting bacon. I asked the waiter how long that had been sitting out for; he said he didn&#39;t know, so I asked for some fresh bacon. He asked, &#34;you want fresh?,&#34; which was confusing yet slightly humorous.... Yes, bacon is awesome, but it&#39;s even awesomer fresh!! Super excited they serve breakfast all day, but bacon &amp; eggs with potatoes and toast will run you about $10. My grilled cheese and side of bacon ran to $7.85, as I also just had water. The most expensive item on the menu (which just hangs from the wall) looks to be the T-bone steak for $28.50. It&#39;s open 24 hours and is cash only.	1
Service was pleasant, but the food, drinks, atmosphere and music were sorely disappointing. Would not recommend this restaurant.	0
I love this place everytime I order from here I get great service and a quick delivery! I would recommend their lobster grilled cheese and their chili cheese fries oh and their chocolate banana shake. Not really a fan of their falafel wrap though	1
This place is trying to be all hip and aid back with it's big picnic-style tables, no-frills margaritas in tumblers, and authentic street tacos, but really Petty Cash... you fancy. Fancy, in a good way.The food is bomb-from the guac and chips, to the fish taco to the crispy brussels sprouts-it's like gourmet street food and I wanted to try it all. One of my friend is a vegetarian and she found plenty of good stuff on the menu to eat.(I highly recommend making a reservation because this place is busy).	1
These people are extremely rude! Yes you man be bz but you must learn that being respectful to your guest esp when they are calling to ask if you are open on Xmas day that you should take a moment to speak to them with manners! I will never give you my business and will tell everyone I know in Vegas ( which is A LOT of people) to NOT GIVE U BUSINESS!	0
Mac Daddy Cheese balls... Mac Daddy Cheese balls... Mac Daddy Cheese balls... Mac Daddy Cheese balls!!!! Sooooo... on that note, TRY THEM!!!!! :) I've only been to this place late at night with a group of four or more and the service has always been great. It's a cool place nothing crazy or fancy nor sketchy, very comfy diner. Maybe a bit too comfy? The seating really sucks here it's a bunch of booths for "four people" it's really seating for two, the seating is my only complaint but other than that it's a cool spot.... Oh WAIT! PARKING!!!

New favorite pizza in the neighborhood. Thin, crispy and long brick oven Roma style pizza - full pie 8&#34; x 40&#34; approximately is $17, margarita is $10. $2.75 slice. The service is friendly and the pizza is great. Tried the fresh mozzarella Roma, pepperoni, and zucchini-fresh tomato-artichoke pizza. Excellent! Pasta too!<br>Traditional Italian dishes.<br>No credit card yet the just opened<br>They plan on getting their beer and wine license too.<br>Menus are being printed but I added a caulk board shot.	1
My wife and I have dined at Andre's over 50 times in the past two years, why?   Marc and his staff always exceed our expectations on service and food quality.  I always joke with Marc that we're going to keep coming back until they get it right.  Well, this past Saturday, as we shared with Marc and the executive chef, Cris...they got it right.  What a wonderful meal and dinning experience.   The only problem now is, we have to keep coming back to see if they can top it...and I'm betting they will.   We also have dined at over 30 of the best restaurants in Las Vegas during the same time period (some more then once) and while there are many good ones, Andre's is the best.   You can't go wrong with the food &amp; customer treatment.  Terry &amp; Kathy	1
This place is excellent! Went with my husband and Mom the other night and we were all blown away by the food. My mom and husband ordered the BimBimBap - one with the spicy pork and one with beef. They were fresh, enormous and delicious - for only $8! Easily enough for two people to share. I got sushi and tried the TTT roll, the Spicy Tuna and the Salmon Spring Medley rolls. All three were incredibly fresh, light and the fish was excellent quality. We will absolutely be going back and will be telling everyone we know to try it!	1
I first ate a Malatesta years ago and just tried going back for a friend&#39;s birthday dinner. I don&#39;t know why this place is so busy. Yes, the atmosphere is cozy, but everything is so rushed that the food that comes out is nothing more than slop. We ordered 2 pastas and they were served within maybe 3 minutes of ordering. I understand that ragu is not going to be cooked to order, but it just felt like it was an attempt to close our table and seat the next party. It wasn&#39;t just the speed with which they came out, but it was the complete and utter lack of flavor. We actually started with the mushroom salad special and it tasted like nothing. There was absolutely no seasoning, and I&#39;m a person who always complains things are too salty. Likewise with the pasta. Between the gnocchi with tomato sauce and the ragu, there wasn&#39;t much difference. It was red. The fresh basil was the only thing that had any flavor. Even the grated cheese couldn&#39;t make up for the lack of seasoning in the dishes. We fared a little better with the main dish, the chicken cutlet. There are better Italian places in this area. Don&#39;t believe the hype!	0
Went here last with my boyfriend. The food was good. I had the Sate dinner and I really enjoyed it. My boyfriend has always said he&#39;s not a fan of Thai food but he said he really liked his food last night. The restaurant itself looks a little torn up and outdated. When we walked in nobody greeted us and I had to go up to somebody to ask for service but at least the staff was very friendly.	1

What a great place for brunch and a wonderful menu selection. Southern brunch was on point with chicken and waffles that were amazing. Biscuits and gravy were as true to what I've had in SC on several visits there. Always make reservations as they are quite busy for brunch and I am sure for dinner as well.I'll return soon to try something different as the menu made it so hard to decide and that is a good thing.	0
My Mother and I had hamburgers and they were very, very greasy, as well as the fries.  The atmosphere looks much better in the pictures on their website then the actual place.  Looks like a run down coffee shop.  Will not go back.	0
I went to Beco on a regular basis and enjoyed the food/atmosphere until the bartender (curly hair works on weekends) mistook me for some another black women that had run out on her bill. After accosting me in front of the entire restaurant I paid the bill and left. What&#39;s insane is that the bill I supposedly ran out on was 17$! First let me say that I am black, and I also do not steal and we do not all look alike. I urge anyone/everyone to not frequent this place.	0
Just went there for the first time... good food... good anbiance... my kids loved it.<br><br>Thumbs up.<br><br>#showsometoes	1
music you can actually dance to! :)	1
Kyo Chon is close, tastes good, wings are spicy and its a great quickbite option in the neighborhood. What more do ya need?	1
I drive past The Counter Burger in Burbank all the time. I went to LACMA and there is one right across the street. Friend and I went to have lunch. I ordered a standard 1/3 lb ground beef burger on a pretzel bun and it was really good. Meat was nice and thick, pretzel bun was different and complimented the burger. Ordered the 50/50 fries (half sweet potato, half regular skinny fries). Enough for me and my friend to share. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich on a multi grain bun and he really liked it.I would definitely come back here and try other things on their menu. Overall, I was very satisfied.	1
Wasn&#39;t really stoked on this place. My boyfriend took me for our anniversary for the desert/champagne portion of the evening. <br><br>Champagne selection was very meh for a restaurant listed as $$$. It was like Freixnet and stuff- that was actually their nicest option. Desert was good but our server abandoned us after he realized we only ordered desert and champs. <br><br>Someone else dropped our desert (we had to flag someone down for a fork if I remember right) and never reappeared until our drinks and plates were empty, then he just dropped the check without a word and walked off (I was about to order another glass). <br><br>The manager seemed very courteous though. That was about it.	0
Grade: C+. Solid, but Overrated by Seattleites. Having lived in the Carribbean for multiple years and eating Cuban Sandwiches (aka: el Cubano) made by Cuban immigrants, this place is decidedly average at best. Let's be clear here: the sandwiches are not Carribbean or Cuban (would be an insult to call them as such). They are Americanized versions. The Grilled Pork and Carribbean Roast are must haves without question, though the pork is not truly succulent/moist/falling apart. The aioli (garlic mayo/olive oil) spread is flavorful and unique and the version of the sandwich here is a great Westernized take. However, as more of a traditionalist here, the four chief complaints would be that the sandwich does not use Cuban bread, it does not have the necessary cheese, does not use the real sauce combination (the aioli is good, but where is the mustard/mayo/ketchup mix), and lastly, it is not pressed and crispy.The cheese is necessary because it melts into the meat and bread. The cilantro, lettuce and caramelized onions are all Western additions. I've chatted and spoken with the staff on numerous occassions - they are great, friendly and nearly all have roots back to Mexico (not Cuba). A great addition to add would be to have fruit shakes (Batida de Lechosa, Mango, Pina, etc.) in the similar fashion with milk/condensed milk and fresh fruit. Judged solely on the merits of sandwich taste, I would argue that Tat's Deli has a better/tastier offering and that Hole-in-the-wall colmados in NYC/Boston/RI make better authentic sandwiches.	1
I was planning a surprise birthday party for a group of 20-25 people, so I called ahead to see if they took reservations (they don&#39;t). Since they don&#39;t take reservations and seating was on a first come first serve basis, the manager told me to rest assure that there would be seats available since the place is two stories. He was correecttooo!! .. There was plenty of seating upstairs, so our whole group was able to be together! Yayy!! Since we had such a huge party, the staff members were nice enough to bring the iPad upstairs and take all our orders individually! The amazing service doesn&#39;t just stop there! They gave us quite a few complementary tator tots w/ eggs since we had such a huge party! AND they brought all of our food upstairs! Whoever served us that night, THANK YOU. you were amazing! <br><br>The food was DELICIOUS!! The taco man would be proud. I had the steal flank taco and the tater tots with egg! The tator tots is a must try!!!! They also have this delicious hot sauce that I just can&#39;t get enough of! The red velvet cake was so-so. A little too sweet for my taste, but worth trying.	1
Probably one of my favorite spots in DTLA, and a staple for taking friends from out of town. Classy but relaxed rooftop lounge with food (get the pork belly, truffle poutine, &amp; squash gnocchi) and cocktails that are on point. If you dislike crowds, go during a weekday or make a reservation and skip the complaints. Perch is one of those well-rounded spots that&#39;s great for dates or going out with friends...or one of those nights where you feel like pretending you&#39;re at a NYC rooftop bar in summer.	1
This was a great addition to the burger joints around LA. It added something a little different with its uniquely stuffed burgers and creative salad bar. The Special sauce was great and had a very refreshing taste, a surprise to see in the world of Garlic Aioli and Chipotle Mayo dips. It&#39;s definitely worth the trip out to Fashion District, located in the International Food Court behind the McDonalds. Very good eating.	1
I've been here many times before and had great service, but all good things come to an end.Came around 8 on a Friday night, hostess was nice and seated us right away. That's where the service ended. Ignored by the waiters for over 20 minutes. Everyone walked by and looked at us, but no one stopped. The restaurant was half empty (I can see why) so there was no excuse. When we finally walked out, the hostess just smile and said "Have a great night" in the most sarcastic tone, like it was common place for people to get up and walk out.Luna Park, you've lost a customer, but if you're anything like your service, you probably don't care.	0
Whenever I am in the area, which isn&#39;t often, I stop by Canter&#39;s to grab a corned beef sandwich. It&#39;s the only thing I&#39;ve ever eaten there, so I can&#39;t comment on the rest of their food. The corned beef sandwich is incredible! It&#39;s so big I can barely put it in my mouth. It&#39;s cut super thin and is very moist. I usually put a little bit of mustard on it, but nothing else. <br><br>I sometimes get a side of cole slaw or potato salad depending on my mood. Both are excellent, but these two items could be hit and miss with some people since everyone has their own idea of what these should taste like. They also bring out a side dish of pickles, which are some of the best I have ever had.<br><br>The service has always been great for me. They have a unusual mix of servers here too - from what looks like college students to the very elderly. But even the geriatrics can hustle pretty good.<br><br>The decor here seems to be locked in the 50s or some other time period. Just not anything recent. You know they don&#39;t put all of their money back in to decorating the place. Even though it appears to be old here, it is very clean and makes you feel very comfortable hanging out here.<br><br>I didn&#39;t give Canter&#39;s a 5-star rating because they have raised there prices a lot over the last few years and it is getting ridiculous.	1
I am very sad to report a bad experience at PT. The last couple times I have felt like things are going downhill here but last weekend may be the last time I visit. <br><br>One happy surprise before the bad news. PT has this amazing garden! It is huge and beautifully dimly lit. <br><br>The food was the problem - I do hate to say it. We have a few menu favorites so we ordered those - the lobster special &amp; the tagliatelle with peas and ham. There was also a short rib special so I jumped on that one as well! The lobster was always the BF&#39;s favorite. It was served in a spicy sauce with pasta. YUM. Now they are making it with a regular tomato sauce that was watery and completely flavorless. :( My fav pasta was also a bit below par.. The plate seemed smaller than usual. The short ribs were the worst. I LOVE cooking braised short ribs so I was excited about it but then soooo disappointed. I would say they needed an extra hour cooking. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they were cooked just they didn&#39;t fall off the bone. I had to pick it up with my hands and attempt to knaw it off the bone.... My friend was so grossed out by the extra fat that hadn&#39;t cooked away yet she couldn&#39;t even eat it. <br><br>Oh well, PT was good while it lasted. It is a bummer though because this was one of the few spots I frequented!	0
It was a hot dry day and we had been spending a ton of time walking along Hollywood Blvd, getting pictures of the walk of fame celebs (literally hours) and we got very hungry and very VERY thirsty. Being a big Mexican food lover, I could eat it everyday and never tire of it, I wanted to stop here. I'm SO glad we did! The service was wonderful, the food was great (we got the chicken quesadillas) and they even sell bottled Coca-cola. How cool is that?! Being from Atlanta, bottled Coke is a serious culture there. All in all I cannot recommend it highly enough.	1
I placed my order at 11:12 am. Upon placing my order on your online ordering site, it never told me a pick time or told me to check my email for a time. Just said &#34;thank you for placing your order&#34;. Also, People who came in several minutes after me and ordered on the spot got their food before someone who ordered in advanced? Makes no sense for it to work that way. When I got there the place was pretty busy, but by the time I left It was close to empty and yet I&#39;m the only one still sitting around waiting for food. Food was just okay too, and over priced. Didn&#39;t care for the wrap I got. Won&#39;t ever be back. It&#39;s too bad, cause I work near by and been wanting to try this place for months. But Now I see I am not missing out on that much, in my opinion.	0
These could reallllllly be addictive. The honey is delicious and the spicy is spicy (and I'm Jamaican and eat Jerk chicken on the regular) but soooo good. Great hangout drinking some beer food. Love this place!!	1
I have wanted to try this restaurant since they opened, and was not really impressed. The food was good as expected, small portions but tasty- but nothing I would really go back for. its being done in so many other restaurants. What really stood our to me was the service. Our waitress was pleasant but not really interested ; every single interaction with the manager, busser and food runner lack any form of engaging service. Don't get me wrong, I don't wanna hear your life story- but a smile would not hurt! The hype definitely follows this restaurant around.	0
This is a fantastic place! I&#39;ve been there for wine and cheese tasting before and everything was beyond delish! I have also been hooked on their omelets. The space is a bit narrow so i would not recommend it for crowds. It&#39;s really enough for a 2 people dining experience.	1
Not much to say that hasn't been said before but I really do like this place! We'll stop in for dinner and a drink (or two) before walking down to the Arclight and then walk back to finish our evening with another drink (or two...or three). Service has always been friendly and efficient. Not always the fastest but I've never seen the bottom of my glass before asking if I want another so that counts for something right there! For food I've enjoyed everything from a burger to a salad to the short ribs and it's all been damn good!	1
Happy hour!!!	1
About a year ago I went here and had an excellent steak and crab leg dinner. The atmosphere was good and the waitress was excellent. We went back recently for a mini celebration with our daughter and we were very disappointed. The waiter was sort of preoccupied and unfriendly, When I found out that crab legs were unavailable I was disappointed but understood why as they don't carry them year round. They felt that I still needed to talk to the manager because of my disappointment. I didn't but out he came anyway. He was wearing yesterday's wrinkled shirt with what looked like food stains on it. He also appeared very tired and thus unprofessional.  He apologized for not having the dish I wanted and told me when it would be available next.  The waiter could have done that. They then spilled a drink over the back of my coat. They got me a new drink, blah blah blah..... 2 of 5 stars for a chain restaurant.	0
I&#39;ll start by saying that this place was really delicious before the new menu and chef. The pizzas, smashed potatoes, and chicken with polenta were all outstanding. I told all of my local friends to go. <br><br>However, tonight I brought my mom and was sorely disappointed. The menu had changed and many of my old favorites were gone. That possibly would have been okay, had the pizza been the same. But the dough was totally different - bland and filled with those air pockets. It was just blah, blah, and not worth nearly $14 a pie (that is about individual size).<br><br>They also raised the prices. Our brussell sprouts were $10 and all of the glasses of wine are averaging $10.<br><br>I feel like this place was awesome until they messed with the menu and chef.<br><br>I will say that the service is fantastic. Great waiters and waitresses.	0
Hickory burger with cheese, fries welldone and a side of hickory sauce to dip! Followed by any of their cream pies! Tuna sandwich ain&#39;t half bad either but you just can&#39;t go wrong with a hickory burger! I have been going to the Pan since I was born. One of the best burgers in LA! Some of the servers have been there for almost as long! I prefer the dinner staff more then the lunch staff but that&#39;s just me...be warned you&#39;ll leave smelling like a hickory burger :-)	1
We didn&#39;t actually eat here, but I checked in just to warn newbies about their CASH ONLY POLICY. I find it ridiculous, and they lost our business because of it, but if you regularly carry three figures around it might be worth checking out. Lovely ambiance and helpful servers, what little we saw of them before we read the fine print at the bottom of the menu.	0
Intimate restaurant with a great ambiance. Had the special of the night, a braised lamb served over mashed potatoes. The meat was so tender it just fell off the bone. Nice flavor with the perfect hint of red wine. Tried my friend&#39;s grilled ribeye with garlic butter. A bit on the chewy side for medium rare. Will have to come back to try the mussels and beer!	1
Months ago, before I moved here, the lady friend sent me a picture of &#39;banh mi&#39; fries with the promise that once I did in fact come to NYC I would be taken there so I could sample this interesting take on Asian fusion.<br><br>Fast forward a few months to find Joju really small, really disorganized and the food just okay. Their Yelp offer gave a free egg on anything, so I got the pork belly with egg (runny) and got an order of the banh mi fries. I got charged for the egg, even though I showed the girl behind the counter the deal, she nodded and saw me mark the deal as used.<br><br>I eagerly waited at one of their tiny tables for my number to be called but it took a while to get. Fortunately, it gave me time to review my receipt and noticed the ordering mistake. One fluke in their ordering system and it snowballed from there, kind of like a restaurant butterfly effect. <br><br>We got our food and...it was just okay. Honestly expected a lot more, it was just a fairly basic sandwich made slightly better by the runny egg. My gf&#39;s sandwich had no egg and it was pretty blah. The fries were also similarly just okay, it basically seemed like fries with a bunch of veggies on it. I felt like I could have gotten the same product by eating a big burger and letting the toppings slide out of it. <br><br>Long wait, offset the okay sandwich and the cramped tables doesn&#39;t make me want to come back soon.	0
I ordered the fire of 1889 and it was amazing. The pork was perfectly seasoned the bread was fresh and delicious and the soup of the day (spicy corned beef) was killer. Definitely worth a visit.	1
After a fabulous Thanksgiving dinner at the Peacock we were eager to return for Christmas. However, we were sorely disappointed as staff was short and we had to ask for everything.  The buffet offering was not as well coordinated, and even the simple basics missed the mark. It may have been a result of the last seating, but similar to Thanksgiving hour.	0
Came here for dinner.. This place is EXTREMELY overpriced for the quality of the sushi and amount that you are getting. Smaller rolls are around $6-9, and larger are upwards of $12-16. I had the California Roll and Dragon. Rice, the foundation of any great sushi, was WAY too soft... Each bite of this mess was chewy and mushy, reminding me of sticky rice.. not what sushi is supposed to taste like, and really ruined the overall taste. The dishes are also lacking of consistency- my friends ordered the same roll, but each looked different upon presentation. A good restaurant should at least attempt to have a standardized approach in preparation.	0
Love the food. Do not love the service. <br><br>On a related note, I am not an expert on Peruvian food, but the negative yelp reviews seem too one-sided to be legit. I wonder if the competitor around the corner who happens to be mentioned in the negative reviews is orchestrating them. <br><br>On another side note, the old couple next to me who are taking about their sex life in Spanish (assuming I do not understand) has made this a night to remember.	1
great great service, fair prices and overall quality was excellent. just recently had a house warming party for about 30 guests and we catered from here. food was prepared at the best time because our hot foods were still hot and everything was ready to go.	1
The quality of the food and services  was not equivalent to the price. The bread that was served at the table was cold. We were never offered desert and the waiter was average. I would not go back. The  place has very nice atmosphere. For the money we spent we could have gone else where and received outstanding services and better quality of food.	1
Best Food.GREAT Wait staff.Last Old Time Vegas!!	1
food is pretty average though tasty 	1
Thin Pizza!	1
Iafter reading many good reviews I decided to try this buffet and I was completely dissapointed. Not only was the buffet particularly small but the food was mediocre at best. The crab legs and prime rib were the two best. The rest tasted like it was sitting for a long time. The waitress was very nice. It wasn&#39;t until after I was finished eating that my stomach felt the disaster which I had bestowed apon it. The food made me sick for hours and judging by the condition of the toilet I went into the person behind me agreed. Very over priced fr what you get. Take a walk around the hotel but skip the buffet and go to the one at ballagio for 10 bucks cheaper and food that won&#39;t make you sick.	0
Great food. Very nice owners. I have had at least 10-12 different dishes and never dissapointed. Try the green curry with noodles as a change but everything is good.	1
Norms is unique. Their steak sandwich is my favorite but the boys love the meatloaf and 40s of PBR!	1
I had eaten here the previous week and had a good experience. Decided to go back again today and I guess it&#39;s true when they say you can&#39;t go back home again. I ordered the daily special of a Greek chicken dish that was as tough as tire rubber. The side salad, rice, and green beans that came with the meal were fine and tasty. My wife had a gyro and ordered a side salad extra to accompany it, which is exactly what she ordered the week before. She was satisfied with her meal, but when the check came we were charged $5.95 for her tiny side salad instead of the $3.95 that the menu stated and that we were charged by the same server seven days ago. When asked about this she said that was a small salad and not a side salad and that $5.95 was the price. She turned and walked away very unfriendly. I decided rather than fighting about this I would deduct the extra few dollars from her tip and never go back to this restaurant again.	0
Came here for happy hour with some co-workers. The roof top has a great view and can get a bit chilly at times. We were near the fire pits so it felt perfect for us. On a good night you can catch some fireworks from the Hollywood Bowl.The service here was spotty. It took us a while for the wait staff to come and take our order, but once it got going it was fine.I was pretty disappointed in their happy hour seeing as most of the stuff on their happy hour menu is also on their dinner menu for the SAME EXACT PRICE. Where is the savings here? They have a few drink options that are lower priced, but it wasn't much of a happy hour. The food was good. I had the fish tacos and thought they were tasty. Some coworkers had the burgers and loved them. We also got the cheese plate that had a fantastic pistacho paste, but we had to keep asking them for bread since they only gave a couple of pieces on the cheese plate.Drinks were okay, not as strong as I would have liked especially for the price.	0
I visited Seattle for a month and Pesos was my favorite place to eat and grab a beer or cocktail. Seems like a bar/restaurant where all the cool kids go but also very chill.	1
Upon the suggestion of fellow Yelper, Tom W., I went in search of Tamiami Subs. Not being too familiar with the area, I kinda got lost and checked about 5 different strip malls before finding the place. It&#39;s alright though - it made me want the damn sub all that much more.<br><br>To begin with, the staff is super friendly, and they love to address you by name. Usually I would be totally creeped out by sub shop employees being so nice, but these guys seemed genuinely happy to have customers around. Just as Tom W. said, the man who prepared our sub first asked us if we had ever been to the place and then proceeded to recommend the Garlic Steak sub. He was very pleased to learn that we had come for that exact thing and that we had read a great review of it online.<br><br>The sub, in a word, was tasetacular. Or tastelicious. Possibly a tastearama? Pick whichever one you like; they all do the sub equal justice. I paid a little more than I usually expect to pay for a sub (about $14 for a full sub, two drinks and a cookie), but it was well worth the cost. <br><br>The eating area and restrooms were both immaculate, which is a big step up from other crappier strip mall joints. And they were playing Pink Floyd&#39;s &#34;Another Brick in the Wall&#34; followed by Eric Clapton&#39;s &#34;Layla&#34; while I ate, which won them about 100 brownie points. <br><br>Yelp suggestion FTW! Thanks Tom W.!	1
Wow....yummy!!!<br>Had a crepe - strawberries, blueberries, Nutella, vanilla ice cream with whip. This was only $7.25! The crepe was a really good size and the taste was fresh! The crepe coulda been a little bit<br>More done but it was good nonetheless! We will be back!	1
Steak dinner was cooked the way each of us wanted. The decor was black and white with pictures of old Vegas. We really  enjoyed it.	1
Finally had an opportunity to try this place for dinner at around 7:30 on a Wednesday. The area--Little Armenia--isn&#39;t somewhere I&#39;d really want to hang out in after dark, but it&#39;s not super sketchy. We found parking easily on Hollywood across from the restaurant, and the place was virtually empty except for a group playing pool. Service was friendly and quick; it&#39;s an order-at-counter place, and, from the look of the recycling bin, possibly BYOB. <br><br>They have daily specials, which is nice: Wednesday was burrito (asada or chicken) +chips n salsa = $6.99. I got the asada, b got the carnitas, fish and asada tacos. Total came out to $14. Not bad for a sit-down place. (though I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re really paying for ambiance...it&#39;s super dark in there, reminiscent of the neighborhood as a whole)<br><br>First impressions: salsa was EXCELLENT (and the server was super sweet about giving us a refill). Smoky, spicy smooth chipotle that left my mouth atingle but complemented rather than obscured what it was put on. I should have asked to try their &#34;suicide sauce&#34; and ghost pepper sauce! The burrito was also very good. A little bit uneven--ran into a couple of sizable meat deserts (rice and bean pockets), especially near the last third. But the meat was good quality and nicely seasoned. B enjoyed his tacos verily: he especially liked that the fish wasn&#39;t really greasy despite being battered. <br><br>I believe this place delivers with a $25 minimum, so it would be great for a group. For us two, it&#39;s a solid dinner/lunch option that I will definitely frequent again if I&#39;m in the area.	1
Excellent food, excellent service, very courteous and friendly staff. This restaurant is a gem. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant, you definitely will not be sorry.	1
Meh is right. Food was bland and ridiculously over-priced. The ribs was actually a rib. $15 for a mediocre rib topped with gravy out of a can. Actually, it wasn't gravy out of a can. Gravy out of a can has more flavor. The scallops were pretty good but two for $15 is nuts. Seriously? Two? Way out of line. The goat cheese and pesto stuffed flatbread had way too much goat cheese. I know that sounds crazy but it's true. I love cheese. I could live on cheese. This had too much. And, I'm pretty sure the marinara they put on the flatbread was Ragu or Prego. Pathetic. They almost scored gold with the anchovies but they ruined the dish with a whopping gob of gross mayo. The service was great. We sat at the bar and ate. Bartenders were friendly and kept the wine and food coming. Wine selection was great, too. Unfortunately, neither the service or wine could make up for the terrible food. This place is living on location alone.	1
Thanks Yelp! for the free cactus blossom when we checked in. :) We were debating an appetizer for the table, so you made that decision easy for us!	0
It was my birthday weekend (and just over a year since my breast cancer diagnosis... kind of a big deal). My brother dropped me off in front while he went to park the car. I got the hostess' attention and noted that I had a party of 4. I was told that I could not be seated (even though the restaurant was EMPTY) because my entire party was not present. I pleaded with the hostess to let me sit down at a table (there is no waiting area in this restaurant) and the woman refused, claiming it was their policy to only seat full parties.I asked if I could grab a chair to sit down and the hostess refused. Finally, I indicated that I was a "party of one" and the hostess seated me.If someone is telling you that they need to sit down, use some common f-cking sense and let them sit. The fact that Umami employs morons like this means they'll never get my business.	0
This place is a lot of fun. Typical Wisconsin bar with added feature of ample tables for chow. All food is prepared behind the bar and it's fun to watch the activity. Give it a try for your next pub food outing.	0
Amazing foodAmazing margaritasYummy Sea Urchin guacamoleBest fish tacos I ever hadJeff and Jake really nice guys.	1
Really good! But the entire menu is in Korean so I don&#39;t really know how people who don&#39;t know the language would be able to order..<br><br>I&#39;ve gotten the bajirak kalgooksoo which is enough to feed two people. Pair that with the dumplings, and you&#39;ll be satisfied and full. Other good dishes are the chicken kalgooksoo and the bibim gooksoo. However, I think the best part about this restaurant is that they give you a bowl of barley rice and sesame oil and soybean paste that you mix in. Eat it with the yeolmoo kimchi and your mouth will be begging for more! It&#39;s a small bowl but it&#39;s enough to fend off your hunger until your food comes. <br><br>This place is sometimes VERY crowded and sometimes VERY empty. I have never seen it have just a decent number of people in it. Parking is difficult and you have to valet park for $2.	1
A very disappointing experience. Given all the great reviews, I was expecting great service and food. <br><br>First, the service was lack luster. The waiter took a long time to came back to get our order and then tried to give me attitude. Okay, he knew he screwed up and tried to make it up with a complimentary amuse bouche. However, he seemed to have disappeared after that. For the prices you are paying at this restaurant, the service should be much better. <br><br>Food was just okay. It was just another good meal in the city. I ordered the swordfish which was on the salty side for me. Nothing to write home about. The prices are on the high side while the portions are on the small side and the amount of wine that the waiter pours for you is also on the small side.	0
Made an order in advance for 10 people. They made the order an hour early which we were okay with. But it arrived after a fair amount of time (delivery), so much that he food was cold. The food wasn't great tasting either. Average all round!	0
I'm not one to complain but i felt compelled. My wife and i were intending to go have a happy hour bite at AZUL in mill creek but due to it being packed we decided to try this fairly new place. Menu seemed decent we ordered food. didnt get water. Bar is located pretty much in the kitchen which wasnt fun. Got our baked provolone and calamari sliders which were decent calamari tenders were way too salty it took server at least 15 minute to realize we werent eating our food. didnt even get the remainder of our order. Calamari was removed from the check but not the buffalo wings that we never recieved. And to add to our frustration and disapointment we were shorted on changge by $10. 	0
I have a love hate with this place. I work down the street so I would be a regular had they wowed me over a little better. The food is DELICIOUS which is why I&#39;m so upset that their customer service sucks. I waited for over 30 minutes for my order to go. As I stood there and impatiently texted my husband about how much the service sucks I was leaning against the tall deli case when I had about 30 knives thrown at me!! The waitress was on the other side of the case and went to grab a knife from the bucket when she tipped it over and every knife fell on me. Ok. Accidents happen. I didn&#39;t lose an eye or a toe so I wasn&#39;t pissed about the incident. What I was mad about was the way the waitress handled it. Barely muttered a sorry and then WATCHED me as I picked up the knives that were surrounding me and in between my toes! Had I done that I would have apologized PROFUSELY and then expedited my order and offered some sort of peace offering (even a cookie would&#39;ve been accepted!). No no.. I stood there for ANOTHER 15 minutes while everyone avoided eye contact with me. I was tempted to cancel my order and tell them to shove it. <br><br>Fortunately my sandwich and fries were amazing. Which again makes me sad that the people there suck.	0
Get home at 3am and need some food. Found this place on yelp and called. Ordered some pad Thai and soup. Delivery was fast. Food was delicious and still hot. Found a couple egg rolls in the bag which was a nice surprise. Good portions - legit spicy at level 3. Called when they got to the door. Great spot!	1
Great place!<br><br>I stopped in for brunch with a friend and the food was great! I got the play on Eggs Benedict with their house made sausage instead of Canadian bacon. It was delicious. We sat at the bar and the bartender, Carly, was super nice and made us feel very welcome. I don&#39;t get down to the LES too often but I would definitely stop in here again if I do.	1
I&#39;ve eaten at The Runner twice now. <br><br>The first time I dined here, I was eating alone and sat in the bar area. I ordered from the menu and after a while was informed that I had received the wrong menu... UGH... I was really looking forward to what I ordered... oh well. Ordering round two: I opt for the gruyere/onion flat-bread(?) and the lentil soup with creme fraiche. <br>Overall, the food was good (not amazing) and the service was &#34;rocky&#34; (longer story). -2star overall-<br><br>Now for the SECOND time I dined here:<br><br>My parent&#39;s stopped to visit me for my birthday while on their way back from CT. My best friend is also in town to celebrate with me. We were too late to make reservations for another place we wanted to try, so we decided to give The Runner a try. I didn&#39;t want my previous experience to damper their experience so I kept it to myself (I wanted to give the place a second chance anyway).<br><br>Our meal was great!! Our waiter was great! Wow... totally different experience. <br><br>Right off the bat, the waiter and manager(?) were very friendly (perhaps they remembered me). To start, we ordered the the chopped salad, mac&amp;cheese, and chicken liver mouse. A solid start. Also, while we were eating our apps, they brought out complimentary popovers (with a molasses butter)... wow, they were so good! They alone are enough to bring me back and bumped up our appetizer round. <br><br>Main course, we order the smashed potatoes for the table, my friend and I split the roasted chicken (whole) and my parents both order the short rib with horseradish and beets. *Mind you, I was very skeptical of how they would turn out and what the portions would be like.* What a joy, the chicken was moist/flavorful and the accompanying salad cut the heaviness of it well. My parents&#39; short ribs were cooked well, the horseradish was present but not killer, and the beets were yummy. Our smashed potatoes were good with the creme fraiche, but for me, potato dishes rarely (if ever) blow me away. <br><br>I was genuinely too full for desert, but as it was my birthday, they brought out a piece of chocolate cake with a candle. It was a solid chocolate cake (which I don&#39;t usually go for) with a tasty cream cheese(?) frosting. <br><br>In the end, I&#39;m very glad I went back and had a surprisingly memorable meal! <br><br>Based on my experiences and what I&#39;ve read on here, the place is having growing pains.. hopefully, they can work out some of the kinks/inconsistencies and start on the road to lasting success. I will be back, fingers crossed.	1
Pretty good! I always drive by Amena when I go for my groceries. Looked them up on Yelp and had to try it after reading their positive reviews. We were looking for something healthy that night and it filled the spot. <br><br>I loved their pickled sides and the salad was awesome. The chicken was seasoned well and their homemade pitas sold me; thick and fluffy. But what really sealed the deal was the baklava and mango drinks. The baklava was filled with a strong cinnamon flavor and light on the honey with crushed Pistachios on top; yummy! The Mango drink was light, iced and refreshing.<br><br>I wish the prices were a little lower, but it was a great visit with excelent customer service.<br><br>Thank you for the extra pitas!	1
24 hours AND the food tastes decent.Okay, more than decent. I'm in love with the Roast Turkey Avocado Panini. I mean people, this is the ultimate Panini. The bread is grilled so perfectly that it almost hurts as you crunch through the incredible exterior. Hurts so good.The Lobster Grilled Cheese really ain't my best friend. I ate half and felt a bit queasy from all that mushy creaminess. But the two boys who devoured the other half had absolutely no complaints. Excellente according to these two compadres.Plus, Klatch Coffee! Definitely did a double take with that one, and thought I was back in San Dimas. Good coffee always contributes to a smilier day.	1
The first time I came here the service was awful but everyone raves about it so I tried it again. Came back and still got awful service and the food isn't that amazing. But the worst thing about the entire experience is the valet. Or lack there of to be honest. Not sure why they would only have one person working on a Friday night. Seems to be very poorly managed.	0
This visit I had the lobster roll. It could not have been better. Ordered the fries just plain without the truffle seasoning. They were excellent too. Love this place and it's walking distance to the Music Center and Walt Disney Concert Hall.	1
Ordered a brisket sandwich and an order of baby back ribs and two drinks for 33 bucks. Over priced for the quality of the food. My order was to go and we ate the food about 15 minutes receiving the food. <br><br>Brisket sandwich was horrible. It was so dry that I couldn&#39;t take more that 2 bites. Waffle fries were stale hard and cold. The baby back ribs we&#39;re ok but cold and they forgot the side item I ordered. Will never go back.	0
Pheonemal! I had to have the pumpkin soup after I was given a sample! The greek wrap was so tasty too and not just put together like most places! Give that mango chipotle barbecue a go if you&#39;re a fan of all things barbecue like I am!	1
Okay, I was wondering why so many other reviews compare it with Chipotle. It&#39;s because the place is a mini-Chipotle, but it is a bit cheaper.<br><br>When I went, they were out of pinto beans. Black beans were the only choice. That&#39;s kind of lame. They also didn&#39;t have any crispy shell tacos--which I wasn&#39;t looking for, but it suggests to me that they aren&#39;t quite ready for prime time. <br><br>There are some things they seem to do better than Chipotle: the rice looks better, for one. But the carne asada looked like it came out of a rhinoceros&#39;s ass. I almost ordered it until I got an up-close view.<br><br>All in all, not worth the money saved compared to Chipotle, but not horrible, either.	0
The best pancakes ( flap jacks) I have ever had! The service is excellent (especially at the counter) . Great coffee too!	1
We sat at the bar and it was so hot that I was covered in sweat by the time we left the place. The food was okay but nothing fantastic - I'll try anthing once but I don't think I will be going back.	0
Just what the neighborhood needed. The night we were there it was crowded but the owner seated us quickly (even with a celebrity waiting for a table!). Great beer list, good bottles of wine under $30. Food was delicious and I appreciated the shorter menu - I&#39;d rather have a chef present a short list of masterful favorites than a long list that&#39;s hard to distinguish. The room is very pretty, too. A perfect neighborhood bistro.	1
The food was good, which was consistent with previous visits, however the service was slow and there was an issue with the bill.	1
Spaghetti alla carbonara is hard to make.  I know. I've tried.  The key ingredients are Parmigiano-Reggiano and Romano or Pecorino.  It is a sin to add creme of any kind.  I'm not sure what Luna did but the result was a completely tasteless, sticky mess.  Did I say Carbonara is hard to make?  If the Rockfish filet had been well-prepared, I would not be writing this review.  It too was bland and tasteless.  The service was great and friendly.  If the food were OK it would be a Cheers sort of place.	0
I was driving aimlessly around town when I happened upon this little gem. I had the Hakata Ramen which was great and the broth was delicious! And I decided to treat myself to some mochi ice-cream as well :) My server was very efficient and very friendly considering it was closing time. I think he works off a helluva lot of calories off while he bustles around! The staff greet you when you come in and thank you when you leave. This cozy little place was very happy discovery. A very pleasant experience overall.	1
Ambitious menu foiled by incredibly bad service.I've been here many times over the years, I live right down the street. This place is so inconsistent, you never really know what to expect. But after my last visit I'm not sure if there's anything that can get me to go back.The waiter was way too busy to, um, wait on us. When he did grace us with his presence he proved that he knew nothing about the food that was on the menu.I asked about a fish dish which he described as, "kind of like a Sea Bass" and that it was "grilled". What I got was a tiny trout-like fish steamed in parchment paper. It took a lifetime for our main courses to arrive and when my entree came it was barely warmer than room temperature. I was starving so I ate it anyway. I think it would have been good if it was warm. My girlfriend asked if her dish would come with vegetables since she was craving veggies. He assured her, yes. When it came it was actually a bouillabaisse in which the vegetables were pureed inside the broth. No visible veggies at all. At least her dish was hot and, despite the lack of greenery, it was pretty good. Then our dirty dishes stayed on our table forever as we tried to flag down our waiter for the check. This was on a Wednesday and not even very busy. It seemed like we were at this restaurant for an eternity. The ambience and menu is what makes this place so popular and I have had good experiences here in the past. But bad service spoils the whole experience for me so I think I'll head to Blair's the next time I'm in the mood for fine dining in Silverlake.	0
I went to Per Diem for a drink the week that it opened and found it to be a cool little spot for happy hour. The decorations are fun and interesting. Today, I decided I want to try this place for lunch. I found that Per Diem lacks decent hospitality. The two front desk people were more interested in giggling at each other than asking me if I had any questions regarding the menu. That's not the issue though.After briefly looking over the menu, I picked the chicken sandwich with the heirloom tomato soup. The wait wasn't bad for my to-go order. I work super close to this restaurant so as soon as I got my food, I was back in the office. It was so disappointing to find that the heirloom tomato soup was lukewarm and, for the most part, unappetizing. Seller's Market has better tomato soup. Also, when I tried the sandwich, the bottom was soggy. Overall, maybe I didn't get the right sandwich or Per Diem serves hot soup only if you eat at the restaurant, but I'm disappointed. The bill was $16 - I should have went to Chipotle a couple times instead.	0
My first visit to Commissary was for a late midweek breakfast with a friend. The space is amazing. A virtual greenhouse stands out on a roof ledge and creates a great atmosphere. The sun drenched dining area presents as a warm, cozy and inviting space. There are plants hanging throughout the restaurant creating a true agrarian feel. The items we ordered (breakfast burrito & French toast) and shared were absolutely delicious and I would order either one again; although our server indicated the pancakes are the bomb. Maybe next time. The wait staff was very attentive, informative, and friendly, which rounded out our great experience. The dining room offers the choice of private or communal tables to create community and accommodate parties of all sizes. This would be a great location for a private party or special occasion.	1
So delicious! I got the French dip sandwich and loved it.	1
Really tasty and fresh food. Only complaints are that the parking lot is tiny and usually full, and the food takes quite a bit if you order there. If you&#39;re on a timeline for lunch like I am, order ahead.	1
I really like the Brazilian mocha. Not sure what makes it brazilian; the delicate balance of coffee to chocolate is perfect.	1
Great food! We ordered two breakfast burritos. Extremely fresh and healthy. No oil dripping like some restaurants. Breakfast for two with tax, $22 which is a fair price. The waitress was o.k. while the waiter was great. Super friendly, talkative, interested, etc. he has two small children and talked to us about our infant daughter. Really personable. We were in and out within 45 minutes. No complaints. If I'm ever in the area again, I will be back!	1
I used to love the place. But now i hate it. Everything&#39;s getting worse and worse. Price, quality, quantity, and service. I&#39;m not gonna go there again.	0
I didn&#39;t like it at all, the wait was really long and the buns are hard. The fries aren&#39;t good either really soggy. Won&#39;t be coming back	0
Wow, over 500 reviews for Bloom Cafe.I went here at the suggestion of a relative, and it was a very pleasant experience. We went for brunch. The orange juice was deliciously homemade, super yum. I got huevos rancheros, which I've never had before, and they were so delicious. I would go back just for them! If you're in the area and need a healthy, hip place to eat brunch, hit up Bloom Cafe!	1
Closed Wednesdays? WTF?	0
You NEED to try this place. <br><br>A+ for taste, freshness, and vibe.<br><br>It&#39;s tucked away in the alley behind Melrose Place, which you can either get to from Melrose Ave. or just walk through the commercial building that Alfred&#39;s is in to the back where it connects. <br><br>They have an amazing burrata salad, grilled cheese, some chocolate/peanut butter cake that&#39;s to die for and tons of other stuff. The menu changes week to week but everything I&#39;ve tried so far has been delicious.<br><br>If you want to look cool and hip with your friends, come here. Prices are good, and the food is even better.	1
Definitely a fan of this place and I love the vibe and the fact that I can watch Ballerinas on a Sunday while I wait for my breakfast to be served. We go almost every weekend and have the huevos and the breakfast wrap. So good. Couple of issues I've been noticing since they opened that might need some attention by staff and management:-the flies. went there today to eat a TBA sandwich and I was eating with one hand and shooing away the flies with another. not a good look and quite gross.-two times recently I have gone in and they have been out of the item I wanted to order. the item I drove all the way up for...waited in line behind an indecisive lady and then finally got up to the register to order and the employee told me they were out of what I wanted. PUT IT UP ON YOUR BOARD when you're out guys. NOTIFY us while we're waiting in line so the people behind us don't have to wait while we figure out our PLAN B and also, make sure you have enough inventory on weekends. -service from the kitchen is slow. sometimes it's 15-25 at most then others it goes quite a bit longer. it's annoying when you're hungry. front of the house is tentative and amazing but the back of the house has got some issues or so it seems.The only time when hipsters bother people is when you're not a hipster yourself. Don't let the fact that hipsters hang out here stop you from coming. It's not that pretentious. I'm not even a hipster and the staff is super cool to me and my other half. They are always warm and tentative and want to do a good job. We love this place but it looks like they need to give the kitchen and the flies a good swat in the ass. Oh and the dust on the ceiling that you can see is thick as shit all over the fixtures when you sit up top. Do something about that P + P. The neighborhood loves you and wants to see you stay but you are slippin!	1
At first the crowded, bustling atmosphere with low lighting and only a sliver of elbow room made me wonder how comfortable my dining experience would be... and the answer.. very!As we acclimated to the low lighting and murmurs of conversations, I truly enjoyed the French Bistro atmosphere, which transplants you to a Persian hot spot in the middle of a shady neighborhood in downtown LA.The goat cheese and lavender honey app was fantastic. I'm a sucker for sweet and salty combos.I also got the broccolini side (as an app) which was smothered in garlic and topped with crispy onion rings.The pan roasted chicken was also a fav, as well as the sturgeon in puff pastry.Wine and cocktail list is great too.It's appropriate to sit a the bar with a glass of red, a few apps, and some great conversation.	1
$20 credit card minimum? EFF YOU	0
This place was pretty darn good ^^! I recommend getting the number 3 with sourdough bread instead of french toast or pancakes and bacon!! Can't forget the side of Orange Juice~ the portions are good for the price :)! I would definitely come here again!	1
Two stars strictly for our great waiter Pietro..His smile and gracious demeanor was the best yet in Miami. The restaurant on the other hand leaves much to be desired concerning their food. I started with the Mussels which not only were tasteless ,but those that were actually in the shells were so small that they weren&#39;t worth eating. I&#39;m from Philly and if any place there served such garbage they would be out of business in 2 days. My girlfriend had the fruitta De mare in parchment. It contained pasta, some of those same mussels, small shrimp and was completely tasteless. I had the ravioli which was decent albeit salty. However, it was good enough to eat. The waiter once again was phenomenal and took off the mussels and my girlfriend&#39;s enter.He also comped her a glass of wine. One of the owners or managers kept walking by our table, at least 15 times and never stopped to inquire as to our satisfaction.<br><br>Those that have rated the food highly have absolutely no clue what good food and seasoning is about.<br><br>The worst part is that it&#39;s a great room, however I would never go back.<br><br>If it weren&#39;t for Pietro I would have given this place a negative 5 rating. Really disappointed.	0
Excellent Original Crispy Chicken. Super juicy meat with crumbly yet extremely crunchy batter. Thought it would be similar to Kyochon but the batter & flavors here are distinctively different. Unable to pinpoint the seasonings used - another reviewer had noted it tastes faintly like vanilla and I could definitely see that as It does have a slightly sweet aroma along the lines of coconut oil... Slightly spicy as well. While determining quantity to order I was lead to believe the pieces are small and a half order (8 pieces) of whole chicken would be big enough for one individual. Well, I'm not sure how much of an eater you are and this is coming from a big girl, but 8 pieces is more than enough for two parties. The whole chicken (16 pieces) would easily feed a family of 4. It takes a good 15 minutes or more for an order to be completed so call in advance if short on time for pickup.	1
Hooray for Jewish food at midnight! I&#39;ve only been here once, but I got way more food than I could eat, and I got to stare at a crazy stained-glass ceiling. Oh, and the busboy was wearing one of those &#34;I -heart- Canters&#34; shirts. Freakin awesome	1
I can only assume that &#39;EnHakkore&#39; translates to &#39;No bathroom&#39;. Food was good and well-priced, but no public bathroom is ridiculous.	0
This is a little take out place with some benches that are covered.<br><br>Never had a Fritas being new to Miami. Went here to try them.<br><br>The cuban sandwitch was not very good here. The Fritas were tasty, but quite dry. I have to try one other place before I can really say its specifically this place or just Fritas in general.<br><br>Nice staff as well.	0
My friend and I had the Tuna Nikki. We both got the runs. Go next door instead (Garcias).	0
I&#39;ve been to Fresco twice, once for dinner and today for lunch. The first time I had a salad with grilled chicken on it, and I wasn&#39;t impressed. The chicken was dry and somewhat tasteless. I could have put together a better salad with my eyes closed. I went today for lunch and had the Fresco Combo. Although the soup was good, the sandwich wasn&#39;t and the turkey in it tasted like rubber. My boyfriend had the meatball sandwich and disliked it so much he didn&#39;t eat it. I definitely won&#39;t be visiting again.	0
The Michelada Popsicle is brand new to me, but makes complete sense. It keeps the beer cold while adding flavor! Speaking of. Flavor, the octopus and the pork belly tacos were great. Pig ear salad was decent. The tacos aren't cheap, but are definitely delicious.	1
This place is trendy and new. There are only 6 small tables inside and a short bar. Basically they serve the vietnamese sandwiches. I ordered the 5-spice chicken and my friend ordered the eggplant sandwiches. They are OK and did not wow us. Nothing really specail or authentic about the food. You can get the same or even better ones at half prices in normal Vietnamese resturants. The prices are too high. I gues it is because of the location. It is pretty for Caucasian-ized for sure. No. I wont go back again.	0
I love Canters!The token place to go after a drunken night out. Maybe that's why I love it so much!I don't understand the kvetching about the bitter hosts/waiters since that's what makes this place so kitchy and lovely. The food. The food that's what we're here for, right? The menu can be overwhelming there's hundreds of items. I usually get the avocado melt. Mmmm. They come with fat steak fries. My ex used to get the tuna melt which is also very tasty. I'm not a fan of Italian meats, but I've heard that they are very good here and he's a fan of them. They say the upstairs bathroom is haunted. I didn't know this until a friend told me. I always attributed the moving shadows to being drunk. The bathrooms are scary though. The one upstairs because of the creepiness factor, the one downstairs in the kibitz room because it's tiny. So tiny you can't open the door all the way if someone is washing their hands.All in all Canter's is a classic Los Angeles Landmark and they should be forgiven for most of their flaws as long as they have an A in the window. It's definitely worth a try if you've never been here before. Just keep in mind the quirky characteristics that makes Canter's, Canter's.	1
Seems like they worked a lot of the kinks out. Great view, staff was friendly and food was inventive and very good. Because of the location it&#39;s much less douchey than the typical Hollywood crowd, so count me in!	1
BEWARE! Did takeout here today and was charged $42 for 6 tacos, full pork plate and 2 calypso lemonades and I&#39;ve got the bank statement to prove it. Being new here, I did not question the price but checked the menu pricing found online a little later. What a jip. Never again.	0
Do not go for the 4.99 steak &amp; eggs before it was so good now it is shit. The steak looks like charcoal the eggs suck and the hashbrowns potion is tiny. Go to Ellis island next door don&#39;t make the mistake I did.	0
I love La Brea French bread's chewy outside and soft, almost sweet inside so much it makes me want to move to LA, marry a loaf, and make little baby baguettes.	1
Ick - that's all I'm going to say.	0
beautiful rooftop, food wasn&#39;t amazing but good, service was mediocre.	1
Good<br>Bar food,<br>Nice design,<br>Big patio,<br>And strong beer list. Fine service and chill vibe.	1
recently heard there was a "new" Magnolia, and since i live so close, decided to try it--though i thought the "old" magnolia was a tourist trap with overpriced, bland food that wasn't very well prepared.sooo... we ordered two sausage dishes, chicken and chickpea/pine nut, with two sides each: cauliflower and sweet potato; brussels sprouts and fries. the chickpea "sausage" (really just a breaded patty) had a nice taste and texture, but really needed some kind of sauce or chutney to go with it--very dry on its own. neither of us liked the chicken sausage, which tasted like ground chicken with a hint of beer--it definitely needed some seasoning! i didn't finish mine. the cauliflower (mostly al dente, yay) and brussels (a little overcooked, but nice taste) were both ok, but very oily--it seemed like the crocks they were served in were just coated in oil. there was a huge wad of honey butter on the sweet potato, and the fries were ok, nothing special. oily too. all together, i felt a bit ill after ingesting all this oil and butter. it all probably would have tasted better with beer, but that doesn't excuse the heaviness. all of the sides are heavy that way. service was attentive but it was extraordinarily busy and loud in there, which i can deal with, but combined with the weird food, i can't imagine going back for dinner. after reading about a cornmeal waffle with bacon, i *may* check that out for breakfast sometime --it's hard to find waffles. but my expectations are VERY low. i still say: TOURIST TRAP.	0
We always take visitors here. Love the wine selection and sharing small plates. Especially love the pate!!!	0
OMG. All of these great reviews are spot on. Food great. Service fast. My new place to eat before I get on the plane. You can't go wrong with Mango.	1
It is good. And our waiter was super nice. The avocado toast was tasty. Could use a squeeze of like tho. To add a tang. Hash browns were Delish. Kale was good too. Some pieces had a crisp that was cool.	1
Was the first time here. Was highly impressed with service/staff. They were very helpful and friendly and made their own recommendations. I would highly recommend the Mussles and Fries as an appetizer. Both the Salmon and Mahi Mahi fish entree&#39;s were delectable. For desert, go with the campfire favorite. The Smores!!!!!!!!! <br><br>Overall very happy with the experience and will be planning my next trip soon.	1
Great take on mexican food.  Really enjoyed the ambiance, upbeat but not too stuffy.  Great place to grab a bite before a show at Mandalay Bay!  I would definitely come back for more!	1
Food: the food is okAtmosphere: very nice decor, very open spaceService: dependableIn the heart of japantown, I would go here if I wanted ramen before any other place. But still missing so much..	0
Food tasted bland. Limited menu. Pricey.	0
This one of my favorite restaurants in all of Ktown and maybe js in general. And its def my fav seafood place. Everytime Ive gone there, we've gotten the combos, which are amazing. Everything that comes out from start to finish is delicious there and I have yet to try something i didnt like. My mouth is starting to water js thinking bout it. I will say the ventilation kinda sucks, but with food this good.. who can really complain. This is seafood paradise!	1
Super chill, nice service, food is awesome, Jacque is very kind nd sweet, Mike P Hilarious, shows on Tuesday, only thing that sucks is spacing, where am I supposed to put my hookah, oh I know in the alley	1
Waiter was great and tried his best on a busy night! Manager was completely rude... Not coming back again because of the treatment from the manager	0
Wow. This place was absolutely disgusting. I am not sure how anyone gives this anything more han one star. Ordered the chicken empanadas. I bit into it and it was ice cold. When I call the server over, he immediately says. &#34;are they cold&#34; telling me that this is not the first time this has happened. My entree was the flat chicken with rice and beens. The rice tested old and the chicken lacked any seasoning at all. The beans were bland. <br><br>Why this place has any business is beyond me. It is clear that many just don&#39;t know what quality food is in South Florida. I would highly recommend that you stay away form this pit they call a restaurant.	0
The ramen here is delicious. I ordered the chile and green onion ramen cooked medium. It was quite flavorful but really not that spicy (condiments are perched above the tables however - you can always add heat). 	1
Authentic tasting Italian food. We felt a bit rushed. Food came out much too quickly for a relaxing meal. Smaller portions with reduced prices would bring me back sooner for another try. Drink prices were also excessive. I will probably forego alcohol on my next visit. Too bad.	0
You know that you had an amazing meal when you wake up the next morning thinking about it! My visit to Boqueria was exceptional. The service was spot on. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. Everything she recommended was exceptional. Unless their entire menu is just that good? If that&#39;s the case, I can&#39;t wait to go back and try all the other items.<br><br>If you make it out here, you gotta try the squid-ink paella. OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD! So original and tasty. Mmm. And get the lamb meatballs. It&#39;s packed with so much flavor! I can go on and on about what to get but the only way is to actually get out there and try it for yourself!!	1
I had two bowls of their shoyu ramen in the span on three days. I happened to be in town for a wedding and we came here twice during our stay. The price was right and the variety of ramen satisfied everyone in our group. The shoyu was not as heavy as the other options, but still delicious and rich. <br><br>The people in the staff are nice, too!	1
Clarification: I'm a fan is a bit of over statement. But I'm willing to give it a second try. Why? Because their papaya salad - a must order item on my southeastern restaurant outing - was pretty good.	0
Terrible! We were so excited to try this place and all 3 of us were way underwhelmed. The server was nice and yet it still gets a 1 star. Had the Greek salad which was so gross, I couldn&#39;t stomach it. When my sister tried it her reaction was the same. How can you mess up greek salad? My husband and sister ordered the fish tacos and they were so bland and boring that they both just kinda went, &#34;uh.&#34; We also tried the pepperoni wrapped pretzels that were super gross and the cheese sauce, while ok, was so salty when combined with the pretzels it was almost inedible. The fries appetizers were so tiny, thin cut, nasty and looked and tasted so cheap; and yet surprise, they were expensive!!! After spending $100 for lunch for 3 people (no liquor or desserts) we expected to really like at least one item but we were all very disappointed and didn&#39;t really care for any...and this is coming from the least picky eaters ever. Way better places out there! Try The Social House if you happen to like Japanese...it&#39;s way cheaper (don&#39;t let the fancy outside detour you) and all 6 of us were amazed at how good it was! Another one we tried in Vegas was Goodwich. Yes, it&#39;s a little scary on the outside and it&#39;s kind of a hot dog stand type set up that sells sandwiches but WOW, Amazing sandwiches!!! The 3 of us fell in love! Do yourself a favor and try anywhere else but here.	0
I never venture out into the Everglades, but I&#39;ll probably head back to the marshland for another dinner at Bonsai. The location is out West (out very, very West), but it&#39;s so worth it. <br><br>Here was what we tried: the Rockin&#39; Shrimp appetizer (their version of Nobu&#39;s Rock Shrimp)- this dish was very tasty. We also had the kanisu roll which was also very good (and not to mention cut up to fit, which was an added plus b/c the kanisu roll is usually very big). The E Roll (eel tempura, crab, and cream cheese) was fabulous! So was the chicken pad thai that we ordered. For dessert we tried their fried ice cream, which was superb!<br><br>Our waiter was also very nice and very patient with all of our questions (some of the guests were eating very exotic looking dishes that included lobster tails hanging from martini glasses).	1
Dante's is an experience. Yeah they are really fratty. Yeah they have weird stuff on the walls. But the bartenders pour a mean drink for a very reasonable price. I always order off the nightly specials and have never been disappointed.	1
My wife and I booked this through Open Table because it was close to Sculler's Jazz Club and offered Open Table bonus points.  We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and attentive service.  The Chilean Sea Bass with ginger was amazing, as was the special brown fried rice and the calamari appetizer.  A bit pricey for Chinese, but well worth it.  Warning that valet parking is $10 and no signage to that effect.  But our car was waiting for us when we walked out, so if you're tight for time it is a nice service.	1
So delicious!	1
LARGE GROUPS STAY AWAY!! Monty&#39;s completely ruined my birthday with their ridiculous and outdated &#34;no split checks&#34; policy. How are you going to have large, group-friendly tables, yet not accept multiple cards on a table. <br><br>They encourage each guest to pay as they go (which after a couple margaritas can be a little challenging). The initial credit card ends up paying the balance of whoever paid less, forgot, rolled off drunk, etc. NOT COOL Monty&#39;s.	0
Always great! Great staff, great food, fair price!	1
The view looking out to the harbor is great.  The food and options for Sunday Brunch were above average.  The service was below average.  We made reservations more than a month in advance.  We arrived on time.  Our table was not ready (this was the first seating for brunch).  Once we were seated, the service was fair to poor.  It was very difficult to get the attention of the staff for any request.  What used to be included in the the Sunday Brunch is now an extra charge (and over the top expensive).  Every year the White Elephant scrimps on food and service to squeeze more profit. Disappointing!	1
Can't review the quality of the chicken because after waiting over 30 minutes it never arrived. Waiter never checked on our table either. There seemed to be some kind of preference shown to the phone orders because loads of those came and went. Hate to admit it but we just peaced without getting the food we ordered. This is also one of those places where you're kind of SOL if you don't speak Korean.	0
The brusque efficiency of the servers and the barebones, old-school decor add a lot of great character to the place. The hickory burger had good hickory flavor, but unfortunately, a burger needs more than a special sauce to make it great - in fact, a great burger doesn't need any sauce at all. It was drowning in ketchup and mayo, on top of the hickory sauce, and had a monstrous chunk of iceberg lettuce in it. The meat patty was rather small and not very high-quality, at ALL. Fries were on par with typical diner-quality, in other words, not worth the calories. I went at 3:00 on a Wednesday afternoon and it was still crowded! I really can't believe this made any "best burger" list for the city, it's definitely not worth a special trip or a long wait.	0
This is our second visit to Annapolis smokehouse. The service was attentive and food wonderful. The portion sizes are large so be prepared to have leftovers...which is a good thing.	0
My boyfriend and I love going to this place for late night eats. The vibe is great, so is the food. Lots of veggie options.	1
Good breakfast place, kind of in a ghetto strip mall area. The sign out front says &#34;Bakery&#34; and not &#34;Lemon Poppy Kitchen&#34; which was slightly confusing.. <br>The drink I got was the citrus melody, but what I really wanted was the ginger-lime. They were out of every flavor except the citrus melody and lemonade which was disappointing. <br>I got the standard breakfast- but I don&#39;t eat meat, so I tried to substitute and they were very unhelpful.. Not really willing to substitute for what I wanted even though bacon was more expensive on the menu.. The homemade ketchup is absolutely disgusting. It tastes like extremely sweet spaghetti sauce.. How does that work with eggs? It doesn&#39;t. I asked for eggs over hard- and part of my plate is running with yolk, get my order right.<br>The service was decent, but the food spoke for itself.	0
What a shame... Food is good but carpet stinks so much you don&#39;t want to eat.. We had to leave as soon as we sat down.	0
Small size plates. Very expensive. Food ok. By no means worthy of a second visit with all the other great peruvian restaurants in Miami.	0
I wouldn't recommend Ray's for the everyday working class kind of guy. But this is what is available at the Art Museum. While waiting for a Museum Music Concert to start my friend and I went to Ray's so we could get a drink. We just wanted something quick. Because really we're just hear for the music and if time permits some art.I got a signature drink, and she got a desert. It took forever! My drink should not take more than 25min to serve, especially for the prices they charge. The drink was decent not worth the wait.The desert was beautifully prepared, but a little bland. It was a yogurt like substance.Never gonna go back...	0
The stuffed french toast is the bomb !	1
A bit delayed on the review but here it is!I came here shortly after their soft opening awhile back with my sister. We live literally a block a way and enjoy the vast amount of places to eat from Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Vegan, Indonesian, & now this! The decor of this places is nice, although I haven't been here in the day, I like how dim lit this place is at night. There are a few TVs hanging around in here so you can pretty much catch the game from wherever you sit. They have a ping pong table in the back where they have their fountain resembling a bar tap. I ordered a few things Lobster Sliders, Chicken Parmesan Sliders, Fries, Burrata & Arugula Salad. I'm not going to go in full depth with how each dish tasted but what stood out to me were the Chicken Parmesan Sliders and their fries. I could literally sit for hours eating their fries. I ordered the Lobster Sliders based off a previous review but my buns were slightly burnt in which case I literally just ate everything but the buns. All in all food came out fast and was satisfying. I have yet to come back!	1
For some reason, I have been trying to go to this place since it opened and never got here. Today that changed... <br><br>It&#39;s an eeny place, very clean, great layout. My confusion with all of the reviews I&#39;ve read is this place is KNOWN for it&#39;s burger, so if you didn&#39;t get the burger, you are taking a chance. It is a little overly pricey, but the burger was worth it... <br><br>We did get the burger. Mine came with a little extra something-something, that I won&#39;t get into detail about (it&#39;s something NOT edible) but I do understand that these things happen and did not snap a cord over it. The staff jumped on it and not only made the situation better by getting me a new plate of food, but brought my table little extras and when the bill came, more good surprises. <br><br>Now for the food -- the burger was perfect. It was a whole different deal, being on an English muffin and all, but the grilled onions paired with the Gruyere were pure heaven. It was thick and juicy, but not so large that you felt like a glutton. The sweet potato fries were so perfect that my anti-sweet potato lovin&#39; friends even dug in and remarked how amazing they were. <br><br>I can imagine that this place would be PURE HELL on a busy night, but on a breezy Sunday afternoon, the music, the staff and the ambience was perfect.	1
My best friend chose BarMeli to celebrate her birthday. She contacted the owner and made reservations for a group of 18 people. For being a small place, the accommodation was made. However, for it being such a large party, some people were unable to make it on time or at all. With that said, the owner felt so compelled to confront the birthday girl in a very nasty way in front of her entire dinner table and tell her that it was not fair that she had to turn people away because of our large party. Let&#39;s face it, we cannot control everything. People ran late &amp; people canceled last minute. And still, majority of the party showed, we were only short 4 people. <br><br>I completely understand the owners frustration being that Saturday&#39;s are her busiest night and she turned away business in an effort to accommodate the reservation that was made but there is a right and wrong way to handle every situation. She went about it the wrong way. In having confronted my friend the way she did, especially that we were there celebrating her birthday was just inappropriate, unprofessional and tactless. And she did this immediately after we had already ordered our food and had opened several bottles of wine. She&#39;s lucky we even opted to stay for the remainder of the night given how nasty of an attitude she had the entire time we were there. <br><br>It&#39;s unfortunate that we had such a bad experience because as soon as I walked in I thought I&#39;d be returning in the future - it&#39;s a cute place, the food and wine was good, and they had live music. But the ambiance that the owner set over our table made it such an unwelcoming experience that not one person from our party will ever return to this place. <br><br>If you plan to come to this place with a big party, don&#39;t do it. It&#39;s not large party friendly and clearly, neither is the owner.	0
Delivery review:<br><br>Ordered the edamame which was cold but I figured this would happen because of the delivery aspect. Vegetable spring rolls were great. The tuna tarter was my favorite it was so delicious with avocado and the tuna was fresh it also comes with two sauces that i drizzled on and I&#39;m not sure what they were but they really added an amazing taste. We also ordered the spicy tuna roll and the Jb tempura roll. I personally loved the Jb tempura roll, it not only was not overly fried but it was not as heavy as you would expect a tempura roll to be. We got the spicy tuna roll as well and I thought it was ok, my bf liked it a lot. Finally we got the cheesecake and Thai donuts both delicious. Definitely a repeat, perfect for a rainy night in. <br><br>The only issue we had was delivery time which was slightly over the time expected but it was also raining so that may have had something to do with it.	1
My all time favorite breakfast place. Every time I&#39;m in town it&#39;s one of my first stops. I always order the same thing, 3 eggs sunny side up with bacon, sourdough toast, and fruit and it&#39;s always just right. You also get so much food for such a reasonable price! I love sitting outside and watching the people and cars go by. It&#39;s so refreshing and is exactly the way I like to experience a meal in LA. The people working there are also generally young and hip and love to make conversation. <br><br>I&#39;ve also been told that the french toast and the eggs benedict are pretty great too.	1
Dropped by for a quick meal that&#39;s near my house and waited 60 minutes to receive my plate of food. Never coming here again. :(	0
This is a horrible place if you're a lazy ass!  How do you go to a "restaurant" and have to get your own utensils and then get your food  when it's called. 	0
Even has vegan chowder!	1
The chicken is awesome! We tried both the spicy (which is PRETTY spicy) and the garlic-soy wings, along with some wedge fries and the radish. Crispy, tasty, awesomeness. And with the $10 Hite pitcher deal they had going the night we went, it definitely hit the spot. Will for sure be coming back!	1
Tries too hard to be a Bougie brunch place but lacks the class and grace required both in service and in menu to meet the criteria. <br><br>Other than the most basic rooftop view of SANTA MONICA. The Roof is nothing more than wannabe upscale fine dining experience that thinks it&#39;s something more just because they top their scrambled eggs with caviar and have a few fancy cocktails under their belt.	0
Before they have the midtown location, I ate a couple times at flushing, I really like their food. However, does the cook at the midtown location understand what&#39;s the difference between mild and spicy!!!!! I ordered three times there, all ask for mild, but they gave me the food even more spicier that my friend&#39;s standard spicy. I had stomached twice because of the too spicy food. Plz be careful with your chili oil, not everyone need it that much!!!	0
The best burger I have ever tasted in my life. Well, so far... I have tried Cali and Truffled both was spectacular.	1
I personally didn&#39;t like their food. I got the cabbage soup and added ramen. I couldn&#39;t even eat it because it tasted so bad. We also got the bimbimbop which is basically rice with vegetables. Not bad but nothing special. <br>I did the the potato pancake. <br>The service was not good. The waiter was nice but 2 people at our table got their food at least 15 min after everyone else and they messed up one of the orders which took another 5 min to fix. <br>We ate in the lobby which is really nice.	0
Great food! We're Italian and the food was outstanding! Large portion and good prices!	1
I visited Morro Castle for the first time in at least 14 years this week. The fritas (Little Cuban Hamburgers) were as good as I ever remembered them. Great food and a malted milk shake all under $10.00.	1
Walked in around lunchtime on a Sunday. Figured there would be a bit of a wait considering my arrival time. Took my number and waited for about 10 minutes before being seated. The interior is cozy and the ambiance is inviting. Staff was friendly and brought us our beverages promptly. We ordered a spider roll, rainbow roll and eel cucumber roll which was brought to us seemingly almost immediately. The spider roll came a little after. Rolls were delicious and fresh-tasting. Great quality and a great overall experience. Will definitely be coming back!	1
I was really happy to learn that peppe rosso to go would finally open a larger restaurant. Located in a sea of little italy tourist traps, this restaurant is definitely a neighborhood gem. The restaurant provides a simple intimate decor and to be honest for the prices of their pasta, one really can&#39;t complain. We dined as a group of 6 and were easily accommodated. The one dish that you must order is the RIGATONI. If you are on a budget and looking for cheap italian fare that comes with good food and a quaint environment, I&#39;d recommend this place.	1
I&#39;ve been going to The Pantry ever since I can remember. Their sourdough toast is a meal in and of itself and worthy enough to treck 30+ miles just to eat. Everything else is delicious as well. I&#39;ve only ever eaten breakfast at the Pantry, but the lunch/dinner items sound and look good too. They&#39;ve been open for a very long time and never ever close. To be honest, I don&#39;t even know if there are locks on the doors.<br><br>There&#39;s always a line, especially weekend mornings, so be prepared to wait outside for while before eating. Fortunately, service is really fast, so things move along quickly and smoothly. The Pantry is truly a Downtown LA staple. It may not be the fanciest or healthiest place to eat, but this place has major staying power. I promise you&#39;ll be full for the rest of the day.	1
All I ever get here are the chicken fajitas and those are fairly hard to screw up. Anything else I've tired here has been sub-par. Really, the best thing about this place is the freshly-made tortillas.	0
We really enjoyed Demetris in Edmonds! The food was great and atmosphere was busy. Although busy we were impressed with the service. Good to see a good tapas place in Snohomish County.	1
I can&#39;t stop thinking about their perfect pulled pork sandwich.. everything about it was so good..from the WW wrap, the the FAT CHUNK free tender pork, to the amazing slaw and the spicy green salsa.... can&#39;t wait to have it again... <br>only negative is that their kebab pita meat content was minimal : /	1
We had a great meal and a very good bottle of wine. Our waitress very attentive to our needs	1
I&#39;ve been to OxCart several times and have reviewed it in the past. I still love the atmosphere and think it&#39;s a great addition to the neighborhood. The turkey burger has been consistently excellent, as had the LaVaca burger until today.<br>On tonight&#39;s outing, the service was less than friendly and the hamburger we ordered &#34;medium&#34; arrived overcooked. We sent it back - it took around 20 minutes until we got the new one - and it was also overcooked and dry. Also, the french fries had been redunked in oil so they were overcooked and not fresh. When we let the waiter know, he didn&#39;t seem to care that much and we felt like they could have done more to try and compensate.	0
I waited a couple of weeks to write this review. In the meantime, I had the opportunity to eat ramen at several other restaurants in the City and in the East Bay. All of them were better than the shoyu ramen I had at Suzu. Ok, let me back up...I have been to Suzu dozens of times and enjoyed the food each time. However, on Monday, June 2, I had the worst ramen ever. The broth in the past was a 9 out of 10 has dropped to 0, yes, zero! It was brown, hot water, absolutely no flavor. I don't send food back but I had to. I was convinced the cook forgot to put some ingredients into the broth. The same "brown" water came back. I spoke to the waitress, the cook and everyone was just shaking their heads. The cook said he would talk to the manager upon his return. Whaaaat? They did not offer to remove the ramen from my bill. I literally could not eat it. So, I paid and left. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon unless I hear they have a new cook. I have been eating at Suzu since they opened and have waited in line for a seat numerous times. The ramen, especially the broth used to be one of the best I've tasted...not anymore!!	0
20 or so white linen tables well equipped bar excellent service. I had the lamb chops wedge salad lentils and a spicy carrot pure9e. Delicious I would return weekly if I didn't live 6 hours away. Love it.	1
The service here was amazing. After bringing out the first course on Easter, my date and I informed the waitress that although we weren&#39;t kosher, we&#39;d already ordered the ham, we were trying to keep Passover by not eating bread... The waitress happily replied no worries and she proceeded to bring out everything pretzel baked matza to gafilta fish to matzah ball soup... None of which was on the menu that night... Moreover, they ended up hooking me up with brisket instead of the ham and when I off handedly mentioned I would have Liked to try the ham, the waitress offered to bring some out for me<br>Food was very fresh and ambiance was great, the staff went above and beyond beyond.	1
I went there for a quick lunch break alone, I sat on the bar and ate 2 slices of fresh pizza.. it was heaven. <br>Delicious, fresh and friendly atmosphere.	1
Our server Carlos was very well trained and courteous. He recommended us with excellence. We had the nikei ceviche and the olivo causa to start. Both very good and fresh. Then we had the octopus anticucho which was amazing and the chaufa aeropuerto. The chaufa is very good but big, for 2 or 3. We couldnt fit a dessert into the equation. To drink we had pisco sours, my dissapointment as after the second one I was still sober. Had to ask for a stronger third one. Very well recommend this place.	1
Simple and delicious food. The flavors were really good. I like the retro feel.I had the beef sandwich with the horseradish sauce, mushrooms and cheese. It was very, very tasty. The fries just okay for me but the bbq sauce in the dining area saved it. The strawberry shake was pretty good. I'd definitely come back.	1
One of the best pizzas I&#39;ve had in LA! I was skeptical at first but that quickly went out the window. All the ingredients are fresh and you can really taste the flavor palette in every bite. I&#39;m a total fan	1
The yakitori here is unique to Miami, but having had yakitori in other large metropolitans in the US, it does not even compare. The place is decorated really nicely but the food is not out of the world spectacular, especially for the prices. I would recommend only coming here to try something &#34;unique&#34; if you&#39;ve never had it, but if you&#39;re hungry you will pay an arm and a leg to get full.	0
Butchers and Barbers has pampered us to the fullest! The service is absolutely wonderful, and the food was just amazing. Let me explain the pork chop we had was cooked to perfection, succulent and melt in your mouth tender pork. The beats with quinoa was perfect that ricotta cheese with beats was just inviting. The pig ears reminded me of Mexico, of course they needed to be a little crispier for my tasting, but I understand what the chef had in mind while preparing this dish. I would definitely recommended Butchers and Barbers to friends and family.	1
Don&#39;t ever come here!! The food is amazing, but it&#39;s not worth the terrible service. I have come here with friends about 8 times, hoping each time the service will be better, but no luck. I once waited an hour and 23 minutes for my food. It has become a game for us, how long will it take for a draft beer to come to our table? 32 minutes!! I ordered a steak one night, and was still working on it when the waitress picked it up to take it away. I told her I was not done, and she held the plate for me to eat it out of her hand! I finished my steak with her holding it for me, and she stormed off as if I was an inconvenience for her. Another time we told them we had a group of about 12 people coming, and I was told we are not allowed to have more than 6 people. I looked in the dining room and there was noone in there. I asked if we could push some tables together for our large group and they said no. It&#39;s such a shame because their food is amazing and their signature cocktails are delicious. Unfortunately, I will not be going back again.	0
Sorry, but the fried chicken has nothing on the Front Porch! Our server was great but we had a food runner that was insanely rude. She made giving us attitude an art. Granted, the place is so loud and poorly located that I kind of forgive her. Overall, the drinks and food were good and the atmosphere is fun but don't believe the hype.	0
Went to West of Pecos last night and left very underwhelmed. I've been there in the past, maybe a year ago, and the food was super tasty. But last night...it just wasn't. The service was slow as well. Margaritas were mediocre. They've got so much potential, hope they can find they're groove again.	0
What a great night at Five Sails! I was so impressed on how the restaurant had kept a record of my allergies from last year. This restaurant is a must go once in a life time. The food was amazing!!!! I especially love their duck; however, the portion can be a bit bigger. The service is excellent!!!! Looking forward to next time :)	0
Had a nice meal at Next Door the other night. This was my second time there, my first time was just for a beer shortly after they opened so I wanted to get back in and check it out.	0
I have been to Canter's at least 6 times in my life. Whenever my family and I are in the area, we always make a point of trying to go there. I'm trying to stay away from red meat and Canters' turkey burger is the best I've had. Barney's in Los Angeles is a far second. I've been to a lot of other places and ordered the turkey burger just to compare it to Canter's and none come close. They all taste like sausage.	1
Great stuff.	1
A good brunch and lunch stop in a great location. I&#39;ve been coming for years. Avoid going on Sundays as the line/wait is insane. There are a few couches inside, which is a nice spot to dine. The salads are consistently delicious, and I like that they serve breakfast all day. I love their sweet potato fries, although they have been burnt a few times. However, the staff is always nice about correcting them, refilling drinks, and generally being attentive.	1
After walking up and down 3rd street trying to find somewhere to eat my partner and I stumbled upon this beautiful bar/restaurant.It was rather late so we were worried the kitchen might be closed but our fears were unfounded and were easily sat at a booth inside. It is very dark but the ambience is nice and the waitstaff friendly.We ordered small plates as weren't overly hungry and were not disappointed! The oysters are to die for, extremely fresh and large (Wednesdays they have dollar oysters for those interested), the Spanish Octopus is also great alongside the Pork Meatballs :)The drinks are also delicious and strong- Manhattan is the ticket!A little pricey for what we ordered but the quality of the food is excellent :) Definitely will be coming back.	1
Wonderful meal in a lovely setting on the water in beautiful Rock Hall, Maryland.Kudos to the restaurant to offering a delicous vegetarian/vegan selection to their menu.	0
Some of the bombest burgers in the city.. they&#39;re the no frills type.. just meat, cheese, sauce, fried egg, and a bun... possibly some onion strings but that&#39;s it and it&#39;s pretty killer<br><br>Their mac n cheese is rich and creamy and their fries are salty and crispy.. the perfect complements. <br><br>You could put yourself in a 24 hour food coma if you do all three though.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t too impressed with their bao&#39;s to be honest but that&#39;s not what i&#39;m going there for now that I know how good their burgers are	1
I gave Geraldine's an I like it because I do like it -- for breakfast. I've been to dinner twice however and both times were frankly pretty bad. The second time featured one of the worst hamburgers I've ever had in my life. 	1
Delightful and surprising. Shrimp was cooked to perfection. Gluten and soy free options.	1
I hoped I would love this place but it let us down.<br><br>A friend and I usually go for dinner once a week and like to pick quieter places made for the foodie and wino :)<br><br>This place stood out after we couldn&#39;t get a table at WD-50 but I&#39;m sorry to say it disappointed.<br><br>It started well with nice wine, good bread and good salted butter. <br><br>Appetizers were pretty OK (I had the lobster tail, friend had the bison tartar).<br><br>Mains were disappointing (My lamb was overcooked - not enough to send back but definitely overcooked and overpowered with mint, my friend got the ostrich which he ordered rare and it came out well done - he sent it back while i tried to hold off on eating mine. The second attempt cam out medium well).<br><br>Like I say the wine was great, atmosphere was great but the food did disappoint <br><br>B	0
this place is so cool! cozy little place in the heart of little tokyo...came here on a saturday night and loved the ambiance and FOOD!the wasabi garlic fries and chicken wings are a must try. i've been wanting to come here for happy hour too so expect a review of that in the near future ;)even better part about far bar is it's practically next door to daikokuya. score!	1
Food was good, but I should have checked the menu prices before going. As someone who has eaten tacos for 25 years of my 28 years of existence on planet earth - I&#39;ve never paid five dollars for a single taco, In fact I&#39;ve never even heard of an establishment charging that much, until I walked in, saw the menu and thought - &#34;this must be for 2 tacos&#34;...NOPE! Obvious price gouging, hipster premium tax perhaps? A good taco for $5 doesn&#39;t impress me - make that same taco and make it $3 and you&#39;ve got a winner.	0
Toulouse Petit though! Lol. I came here with my family for happy hour as soon as we landed in Seattle because my uncle recommended it! We ordered a bunch of different appetizers and a couple of drinks!	0
If you like noise, this is the place. Couldn&#39;t even talk to table mates when music was not playing. Reminded me of the noise level of a championship game in a domed stadium after a team has scored. The waitress got two orders wrong since it was so loud.<br>But if you go for the food, it was very mediocre and while not expensive, was overpriced for what they delivered. They do have good beer.	0
let's join the slew of people telling you to go eat here...because it really is just that good.	1
I've been to Eno Vino dozens of times now and it's always the first place that comes to mind when I want to grab an awesome drink or bite to eat. I adore their drinks: The All Natural martini is my go to, but I love the PB&amp;J and Blueberry Cobbler too. My bf and I generally always start with the Ahi Tuna, but recently have moved to their awesome mussels. They change up their menu every so often and I am never disappointed when they do. We went a few days ago and had their duck special and it was AMAZING. I always get the scallops and would happily eat them everyday if I could. Their hanger steak is a must too, the mashed potatoes underneath are awesome. The waitstaff is always very knowledgeable and prompt. We generally finish up with the fondue and I somehow always have enough room to finish it. It's a little spendy but I feel like you get so much amazing food that it's well worth it. The decor and seating is great too. I have no complaints about Eno, I'll be back again soon!	1
I love this place.. There is nowhere else like this place... Might have to wait a very long time but if u pick ur spots it can be no wait... If u go late U have a better chance of not waiting. Food is great and I love this vibe here.. Be warned... U will stink like charcoal at the end of the dinner but it's well worth it.	1
Went on a Sunday around 3 pm. There were only two other parties. By the time our food came, there were two more parties. So obviously there was no wait. The jjajjangmyun noodles were good. my husband got the regular size and I got the small size. We also got the Mongolian beef which was yummy! This is the first chinese-Korean restaurant I&#39;ve been where the Kimchi is made with napa cabbage (the way Koreans like it) rather than with regular cabbage and the first one where I saw radish kimchi served! Cool... The remodeled interior is beautiful. I like the corniced ceiling and lighting cause I actually like to see the food I am eating.	1
This is probably the best Vietnamese sandwich shop I have been to. Their bread is toasted and feels the most fresh. The meats are tasty. Their pickled vegetables are just the right amount of both tangy and sweet. And, as with most sandwich shops of this kind, the price point is nice: $3.75. I can&#39;t complain there. Especially since the sandwich is bigger than most you&#39;d see in New York.<br><br>Note that it closes at 6.30 daily.	1
mmmmm...CARBS.wish my thighs didnt like this place so much.	1
Very upset with their no modifications policy. I totally understand that they don&#39;t want people messing with their food by adding all kinds of crap to their dishes... But if someone (me) has multiple allergies, why the hell can you not take it off of something? Like it is so hard? Like the dish completely suffers because of the cheese? Is this a growing trend in LA- a pompous chef who won&#39;t accommodate their customers? Yup, sure seems so... I love that next to their no substitutions or modifications line is a line that says alert your server to any allergies. Um, what&#39;s the point? You can&#39;t help me anyway. I&#39;m allergic to a variety of things, and unless you have a doctor back in your kitchen, there is no reason I need your help to keep me away from food I very well know I&#39;m allergic to. Sucks too. I wanted to like it there. But the arrogance completely ruined the experience of what could&#39;ve been awesome.	0
THIS PLACE IS RIDICULOUS. YOU SHOULD SUE. <br><br>You can get better chicaron at Manila Oriental or Pacific Super. What is there to &#34;halo&#34; in the Halo-Halo? ..its basically milk &amp; ice! Also, the waiters/waitresses don&#39;t have any knowledge as to what filipino food really is. At lastly, the plates look like it&#39;s from chinatown which doesn&#39;t make the food any more appealing.	0
On my quest for the best L.A. burger, I ventured down to Apple Pan. I am not sure where all the hype for this place comes from because it does not deserve it. The food is OK, the service is terrible, rushed, and inconsiderate. Apparently it is a crime to ask if they make a double cheeseburger (which they will not). My waiter said no to all of my questions before I even finished asking them. I joked with my brother that he should have a &#34;NO&#34; button on the counter so he could just press it at the customers and save his breath, which he obviously did not like to waste. And good luck coming with more than two people, this place is so small and crammed that we saw families having to split up and sit at opposite ends of the counter (which is all this &#34;restaurant&#34; really is, a counter. A counter with SUPER tight seating). It is a struggle to even get in this place, you open the front door and suddenly your standing in the walk-in fridge. Also, if you prefer restaurants that serves food on plates, the Apple Pan probably isn&#39;t for you. Burgers are handed to you wrapped In N&#39; Out Style sans box. Fries come on a small paper plate the size of a small bread plate. <br><br>Pros - The fries are amazing, probably the best I have ever had. They are super clean, hot and crispy....I believe fried to order in very clean oil. The steak burger is OK, but I have had much better &#34;classic style&#34; burgers at countless other places. Daglas Drive-In Burgers in Canoga Park kills this place just to name one. And I would choose a Bob&#39;s Big Boy Double Deck over an Apple Pan Burger any day of the week. <br><br>The Apple Pie w/ Ice Cream is by far the best Diner Style Apple Pie A la Mode i have ever had and is rivaled by none - perfection. <br><br>Cons - I know the little paper cone cup idea is quirky, but it actually makes your beverage difficult to drink! Don&#39;t go to Apple Pan thirsty, because all you can do is sip out of this snow cone. Also only can soda at $1.50 a pop. No fountain - BOOOOOOOOOOOO! Cash only!!! Boooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!	0
My sister and I shared shrimp and lobster tacos along with fresh chips and guacamole. The chips are so warm and fluffy and the guacamole and salsa are really good. I enjoyed the tacos and my favorite were the lobster tacos, but my sisters favorite were the shrimp so it depends what you like the most. We also got a tamale, which are not stuffed. The chicken ( they have other than chicken) is on top on the tamale with sour cream and avocado. They are so delicious and the tamale is so soft and it&#39;s a crazy blend of flavors. I got a cucumber and mint water and it was really good and my sister got watermelon which was equally good. The churos with the homemade chocolate are really good to, they just melt in your mouth. The staff is so friendly, and always checking what you need. Our server was James and he was really nice and attentive and giving us his opinion and he did not let us down. Best place for tacos, hands down!!! The location is perfect and the vibe inside is really relaxing and friendly and the design is really cool and unique!!	1
A vegan or vegetarians paradise. I had the taboulet salad which was very generous in portion size and delicious. The vegetarian white ham in the salad was so tasty and really tasted like ham. So large I had enough leftover for lunch the next day. Really recommend this place.	1
Awesome place with great food and drinks. A little out of the way, but worth it if you&#39;re in the area. My friends had the chicken and short rib burger, which were both delicious. I had the mussels which weren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but certainly good. Also, the dishes were running behind and the manager offered us dessert for free as an apology. That&#39;s all it takes to make me a happy camper!	1
Ok so Ludo and the Animal people got together and Petit Trois is the lovechild.<br>I went with a group of friends and waited patiently for a table because they don&#39;t take reservations. We were a party of 4 and the place is so small that it took a while and other smaller parties were seated before us even tho we were there first. The waiter was very nice and fed us delicious bread and butter while we waited. <br>There were only 5 items on the menu so naturally we tried them all. And both desserts. Everything was excellent with the Steak tartare being the stand out dish (I normally hate steak tartare but this one was sweet and tangy and didn&#39;t taste at all like steak) and the Napoleon dessert. <br>The only thing we didn&#39;t get was the Croque Monsieur because it&#39;s only served after 10!	1
Satisfied my hunger. But even my hunger could not ignore how poorly prepared my vegetarian noodles were. It&#39;s noodles. I&#39;m Asian. It ain&#39;t that hard. Not worth over $5.99 but I paid $12.00. Noodles were sticky and seasoning stuck together.	0
Nothing better than fresh Italian meats and a great wine selection. Highly recommend D&#39;Oro when looking for a quick bite of fresh Italian cold cuts. Very friendly and attentive staff to make the experience even better.	1
2.5 stars<br><br>I&#39;m a brisket fanatic. This brisket was really disappointing, especially since it was the first thing our server recommended so I assumed it would be great. It was pretty tender, but it lacked the smoke and flavor that makes good brisket. You can get better brisket at Blue Smoke in Manhattan, and hear really good jazz while you&#39;re at it.<br><br>We also ordered cheeseburger sliders which were fine, fried green tomatoes (fine), fries (fine) and mini-wedge salad (hard to screw up but they added BBQ to the blue cheese dressing and personally, I&#39;d stick with regular blue cheese). As for their sauces, I tried 2/3 and must admit that even as a novice cook, I&#39;ve made tastier BBQ sauce at home. The habanero wasn&#39;t spicy. The regular wasn&#39;t sweet or tangy. <br><br>This was much more of a corporate chain restaurant experience, not down-home authentic BBQ. It reminded me of Claim Jumper, which is significant, I think. The restaurant itself is huge by New York standards, and you feel instantly transported to the suburbs. On the way out, we noticed another BBQ place across the street, so it appeared suspicious that Dino chose that location - typical corporate restaurant maneuver. Think about all the Starbucks that open up next to independent coffee shops. It&#39;s not an accident.<br><br>Dinosaur BBQ was much-hyped, but afterward I just felt greasy and had an upset stomach. Like I was about to give birth to a stegosaurus. Just enjoy that mental image for a moment before you decide to give this place a shot.	0
This is a great place without the pretense. It would not surprise me if they served blowfish to distinguished guests. I asked and they said it&#39;s illegal in California go to New York. Shucks, was in that kind of mood last night...<br><br>Back to the sushi: very big sashimi portions. Do yourself a favor and start with the sashimi and see if you have room for more. If not take a break, have some sake, beer, air, whatever and then dive in for more. Reasonable pricing for the portions. Two people with hearty appetites can be in and out for $80 with two tall Sapporos.	1
I would give the food and ambiance a 5 star. Service was definitely a 2-3 star...typical of K-town. <br>Had the Redondo combo which was a good price for what we got. Medium spice (holy sauce) was perfect for our taste. Definitely spicy, but not crying over our food. <br><br>The service was sub-par. You need to do a dance around your table to get the wait staff to come by. And their English was more than questionable. <br>However, the food is definitely good. We went at 6:30 on a Saturday and only needed to wait 5 min. The place is full, but not over-crowded. <br>SO, if you want some good seafood, minimal wait, and don&#39;t mind barely, ok service. Go for it! We&#39;ll go back as we live in Ktown, liked the food, and are completely used to this type of service.	1
Westward is awesome. We had our name down at another oyster bar that I really love (see other reviews) and it was going to be over almost an hour wait so we decided to drive over to check out this place.	0
Dammit. It&#39;s pretty good. <br><br>I am an omnivore, so no Vegalitarian judgements here. It&#39;s just plain tasty. They&#39;ve got a spot at the tiny little farmer&#39;s market a block over from my apartment and I&#39;m starting to become a frequent buyer. It&#39;s got to stop though. I end up spending meals&#39; worths of money on side dishes that I pretend I will nibble on for the rest of the week. Usually I&#39;ve gobbled up the whole container by evening. My gullet is so greedy. So far I&#39;ve tried the Tempeh, Seaweed Salad, and Spicy Daikon. All great. <br><br>I motion to have a Fan Club promotion. Buy 5 get 1 free or some sort. Yeah yeah? Give us po&#39; peeps some love, Dave!	1
1. Wide array of wine selection<br>2. Excellent display of cheese etc<br>3. Friendly and knowledgeable staff<br>4. Try sitting facing Melrose- it&#39;s like watching National Geographic.<br>5. Be merry while there!	1
If you love perfection, Center Cut is the place to go for steak and  prime rib.  They are a steak house only.  You can get turf with your meat, but this is a true steak house whose main focus is the beef. The Trio of Bacon appetizer is a creative and taste sensation.  I am still dreaming about the best Oysters Rockefeller I have ever had.   It is pricey, but it is worth every penny.	1
Had brunch there and thought the food was not that good. The potatoes were extremely greasy the bacon was over cooked and the bread had way to much cheese. Had reservations and was seated in the bar.	0
Now that summer has officially started The Roof has some new menu items to get you in the sprit! Chef Greenspan is at it again! Starting with fresh Baja style tempura fried fresh Red Snapper fish tacos! Served with a nice cold beer and some limes I am in heaven! Also have a beer tenderloin and lamb shank with mole reduction. This places is getting busier by the day so make sure you make reservations for some good food, fun, and fantastic 180 degree views of LA!	1
Full disclosure, owned by personal friends. That said, I know how much thought went into this place and it shows. The best cheese curds in town, which should put them high in the running for best cheese curds in the universe. The Lazy Susans are a great sconnie take on meze. Egg-topped buger was fantastic. This was my first liquid old fashioned experience. They are tasty and come in various permutatations, the table favorite was made with applejack. Ho-maid ice cream an excellent finish, recomend the buttered beer nut. Lactose intolerants, veg, maybe vegans can find something.	0
What a nice surprise. Like some of the other reviews, I expected the food to be bland and boring, but was very well pleased with the quality and flavors. The food was not as heavy and overly filling and they would be at a non-healthy authentic restaurant. We ordered the "spicy seafood rice noodle soup", "half and half beef and pepperoni pizza" and the "seafood risotto". Everything was good, tasted authentic was delish. I forgot it was healthy food.I agree that the atmosphere is nice. It is pleasant, airy and does have a clean healthy feel. I felt like I was @ a restaurant in South OC.Overall, I was impressed. I don't normally do healthy, but will definitely recommend and come back here.	1
I've been here a few times now and have received excellent service each time.Fantastic little cafe with delicious food and friendly wait staff.Inside the atmosphere is very cute and a great little escape if you want to treat yourself to solo brunch and a novel.I recommend anything with eggs, their guacamole is amazing and the Red Velvet Cupcakes are to die for.	1
I am not big on writing reviews, but I felt compelled to write after my experience tonight at Marlow and Sons.<br><br>I will preface by saying that the food was delicious and inventive. That being said, the service and overall experience truly let the place down. I was taking my mother, who was visiting New York, out for dinner and it was unfortunate that the evening had to be tainted by poor service. <br><br>When our mains arrived, one (the fish) was completely cold, and the other was lukewarm at best. I was extremely hungry and so overlooked the fact that mine was lukewarm, but we sent the other back as it was just unenjoyable. <br><br>Afraid that my dish was going to get even colder, I picked at it trying to stall until the second dish returned. By the time it returned I had reached the final stages of my meal. The waitress was unapologetic, and seemed to have no concern over the fact that their mistake meant that we were each eating our meals alone. The whole dining experience was thrown off. One expects better service considering the prices. No efforts were made to compensate for the mistake.	0
This is a truly classic burger joint. Many have tried to be the Apple Pan but there is only one. The hickory burger with cheese is amazing! It is easy to decide what you want because they only make a few things but they are all top notch! The fast service grantees the hottest burger and the freshest fries on town. Don&#39;t forget to save room for a piece of their home made pie!	1
When I first moved into the neighborhood two years ago these subs were awesome.	0
The quail and waffle cup was amazing! They have a pretty good whiskey selection too. I recommend the combination.	1
How can I not give 5 stars to a place with amazing choices of beer & a far too good choice in burger selection. I was hesitant on whether I should go for the Far Bar Burger or the Italian Samurai Burger. Mmm, they both sounded too good to be true. I ended up getting an Italian Samurai Burger with a side of cold beer (Golden Road Hefeweizen). If you like hefe, I would definitely recommend you try that one. I was pleased with my end result. They have happy hour from Tuesday - Friday: 4-7 and Sunday - Monday: 4 - Close. They had a little selection of sides to order on the happy hour menu, and I said heck, why not try the wasabi fries. NO... Do not get it. I had one, with just a small tiny bit of wasabi and it was burning in my nostrils I wanted to throw up. Besides the nasty fries we got, the happy hour selection is really nice. I went ahead and tried the hoppy. I am not a big fan of IPA, but the 4 he selected were just in my taste bud. I can't remember exactly what they were, but I'm sure whatever the bartender gives you will be just right.Ps. The restaurant is hidden in some alley way with just a small sign saying "Far Bar Entrance", so be on the look out for that if you are having a hard time finding the place.	1
While I am not one to make the same mistake twice when selecting a dining location, I was roped into a recent return. The first observation which sent my radar on alert was that our waitress was responsible for about half of the restaurant's tables. While her demeanor was happy and professional, there were a number of problems. One of the diners in our party was given the wrong soup and dressing on the salad (she had asked for it on the side-it was served drenched). She ended up waiting until the rest of us were 3/4s of the way finished. My order was called brisket hash, and the concept was underwhelming. The meat was cut up into rectangular pieces that reminded me of how some overbearing mother would cut up their child's food, rather than the traditional consistency of breakfast hash. The plate was unusually hotter than the food, which made me wonder if a microwave was used to rescue an unattended plate. Another diner at the table had asked for egg whites and were given regular eggs, resulting in another delay. The fault here lies not with the server, but the management, for not properly staffing their restaurant on a Sunday at noon.	1
If you are willing to drive distances to try out a great hole in the wall, then put Mama Maria&#39;s on your list of places to try. Someone told me about this place a few weeks ago and have been wanting to go since. We finally made the trip way out to the Northeast and were rewarded with fantastic food, reasonable prices, and friendly service. <br><br>After debating between several items, we decided to order the chile verde, enchiladas verdes, and a chile relleno a la carte. The chile verde ($8.50) consisted of tender pieces of slow cooked pork bathed in a tangy tomatillo sauce, and was served with a side of fluffy rice and refried beans that tasted identical to those we had at a little lobster village in Mexico. The pork was fork tender and I loved the large meaty chunks, but I would have preferred it to have a few more hot chiles. The chile relleno ($5.50 a la carte) was also worth the trip and we even thought it was better than that of Vega&#39;s cafe, which previously held our number one spot for this dish. Rather than a white sauce, this was served with a perfectly executed red tomato-based sauce. The batter was thicker and had a good amount of egg, and there wasn&#39;t a superfluous amount of cheese in the center. The combination of these two factors pleased me because it resulted in more protein, less fat, and a more interesting flavor combination. It just felt like a more balanced dish than the other chile rellenos I&#39;ve had. The enchiladas verdes ($8.99) were the least impressive dish, but still better than enchiladas at most other restaurants. I appreciated how the green sauce for these was different than the chile verde sauce used for the pork, because it showed me that each dish is thought of independently. My husband commented on the skill used to prepare the sauces here as they weren&#39;t broken (culinary term meaning the fat and acids haven&#39;t separated from one another), and I agreed. Even though the food here could be equated with awesome home cooking, the skill level necessary to prepare each of these is probably underrated in the eyes of the consumer. I really wanted the tres leches cake since that is on my top five list of favorite desserts (the best I&#39;ve had is at Cuba Cuba in Richmond, VA), but sadly they were out so we settled for the flan ($2.50). This turned out not to be sad at all, because despite the weird presentation with plastic covered toothpicks, the flan itself was creamy and the caramelized sugar syrup was toasty and rich. Plus, it was the perfect size. If you don&#39;t want to try the desserts here, however, you can go to the shop next door to get homemade ice creams and popsicles, which are also inexpensive.<br><br>Though I&#39;ve only been once, it seems like the food here would be fairly consistent since it&#39;s run by a couple from Guadalajara who manage the restaurant and do all the cooking, just like at Vega&#39;s cafe. Adding to the charm is the old fashioned diner wheel system for reading restaurant tickets, a refreshing sight in a country whose restaurants are filled with P.O.S (point of sale) systems. Plus, it&#39;s always great to support a Mom and Pop kind of place!	1
Horrible. I called in to get a pizza delivered and the guy on the phone told me that I live really close and that I should pick it up myself. I thought he was joking, well that wasn&#39;t the case. I quickly found out he wasn&#39;t. If that&#39;s not enough, after picking the pizza up myself because my hunger was greater than my pride, the sauce was ridiculously sweet! Maybe that&#39;s their thing, but that isn&#39;t the kind of pizza I&#39;m looking for. <br><br>The pizza I can see some people liking, especially drunk...but the customer service is awful! I won&#39;t go back. I found Evio&#39;s which is way better and they are so much nicer there as well. I don&#39;t mind spending my money there.	0
Sweet staff, good food.	1
Any place that you can get Eggs Benedict six different ways at 3am and sells the most amazing hamentashen ever gets five stars from me!	1
Awful service, mediocre burgers and bad experience. If the service was better, i'd be all for it. However such an unfriendly staff makes the whole experience awful	0
By far one of the best most juiciest and gratifying burgers. The only thing is the burger makes you want a second. The original ramen burger is good. The garlic and seaweed fries are good not all that grand, but the burger is the go to thing. The you can't come to la and not try it kinda thing.	1
So I am offically popping my yelp cherry with this review...I came here last Saturday for a friedns birthday celebration. Showed up around 9:30 (right before the line formed) It is surprising placed on the rooftop of a building in Pershing Square. After a trip up two "vintage" elevators the doors opened and we were in a parisian rooftop bistro. Being a lover of Los Angeles and everything it has to offer, I was floored by the beautiful architecture and 360 degree views. The layout is an open floor plan with plenty of lounge seating. I rated this place 4stars versus 5stars because of the restroom availability on the 15th floor, mainly because there was a private party on the 16th floor and the bar clientel had to share the restroom with a wedding reception (sloppily drunk wedding guests @10pm is not my cup of tea) Besides that this place is amazing and definately a MUST SEE!	1
OK; simply put, this place is AMAZING. You are taken away by the ambiance. You are completely unaware that you&#39;re still in LA. There is no signage on the outside of the building to make it feel even more secluded. The food is amazing. We went with a group of 10, so we got to sample pretty much everything. (duck, duck ravioli, scallops, chicken breast &amp; the fillet mignon) it is well worth the price. this may not be the first date kind of place, but certainly anniversary, birthday, second date kind of place. It is definitely a &#34;must see&#34; in LA.	1
The food was excellent and our experience would have been a wonderful one until we received our over charge check. Not only did our server charged us for an extra item (clam) which was resolved as a reprint of our check. The second check we received also had an error of charging us with an octopus plate which wasn't available for the night. My card was charged with two incorrect transactions that resulted in a phone call from the bank then calling the restaurant twice. The situation wasn't handled professionally nor did the manager provide any compensation for the inconvenience. 	0
Just making sure people in this area are aware of this gem. Top shelf! Spring mountain now extends to buffalo and flamingo. Highest endorsement.	1
We have lived in the area for over a year and Bloom has been on my list to try - but the reviews were always mixed, so I had been putting it off. Well - we finally popped in for dinner last week and were SO impressed! The atmosphere, food, and service were totally 5-stars! The hubby had the lamb burger and I had the salmon bowl (at the suggestion of our waitress) and holy god - the salmon bowl seriously blew my mind and my hubs was way happy w/ his as well. And we shared one of the smoothies for dessert and this was also TOPS. An added bonus for me was that my iced tea cup was NEVER empty! I am the thirstiest person alive and was very pleased to always have a full cup. The slightest smallest negative comment I have is that it was a bit chilly inside. But that could have easily been me and my 100 cups of iced tea - ha ha. We took a look at the breakfast menu and it's full of yummy items. We cannot wait to come back to try more off their menu (although - to be honest, it will be difficult to do something other than the salmon bowl).And if all of what I have already written doesn't sell you - they offer BYOB with NO corkage! It doesn't get better than that in my book. Now that we know - we'll definitely be showing up with a bottle or two.	1
I really enjoyed my experience here and opted to give a more generous rating since the restaurant is new and I felt the food showed promise. In addition, I think it&#39;s important to note that we ordered from the prix fixe menu, which, at some other establishments, results in a scrimp on quality with the reduced price. I felt that Da Claudio delivered solid meals with ample portions even for their prix fixe menu. The choices were very limited, but I felt they did them well. We had the lasagnette and the chickien scallopini. The chicken was not drenched in sauce (that&#39;s a plus in my book) and I have just about never ordered lasagna at a restaurant of my own accord, but since we were going with two out of three choices and the only other thing was clams, we opted for the lasagnette. I was satisfied with chicken and was pleasantly surprised by the lasagnette. I was also surprised to have some roasted fennel on my plate- that certainly contributed to my desire to bump up the rating. <br><br>The bread served prior to the meal was good and there was a nice selection, but I did note that it came to us cold. A mark of a detail-oriented management ensures that the bread comes out warm. A small detail but one that we noticed. I did however, like the clever olive oil spread that was served with it. <br><br>Dessert was tiramisu- with the special menu, you only get one choice of dessert, but again, I was satisfied and happy with the choice. <br><br>Small drawback for me personally was the ambiance- while it was nice enough, I felt it could have a bit more charm, and I kind of relate to what another reviewer said about it seeming like an upscale cafeteria. For the prices on the menu, a more refined decor and set-up would have matched a little better. <br><br>We found the service to be attentive - our water glasses were filled regularly and we were checked on an appropriate number of times without feeling like we were being hounded. No complaints there. <br><br>I definitely feel like this place has promise.	1
We walked in Sunday evening and were immediately seated. The room was lit with candles and low lighting. It has a very romantic feel which was perfect for a date night. It had a bit of whimsy, too with the floor lined with pennies and one of the walls plastered with signed menus from other restaurants. Our server was very friendly and treated us very well throughout the night which I appreciated.	0
This was just awful.<br><br>The parking lot is tiny, it&#39;s in a dingy strip mall, and the interior looks extremely outdated. Sitting inside depressed me.<br><br>I had the worst chicken curry I have ever had here. Three chicken bits (bones, skin and all) and half a potato plunked carelessly down on a bland, tastless goop of curry. There wasn&#39;t enough curry to even cover the chicken! The waiter pointed out that this dish was spicy, but I found it to be completely flavorless. I also didn&#39;t like that they don&#39;t serve brown rice, only white.<br><br>2 stars because my coworkers really liked their garlic shrimp.	0
The food is very mediocre. The wait is often long, even if you get a table quickly the service and food tends to be slow. Their fish fry is greasy and boring, the rest of the menu items are sometimes decent, but overpriced. This place survives on its' reputation and the fact that some people don't like food that tastes like anything.	0
7/7/13<br><br>A plane crash at San Francisco Airport forced us to stay an extra day in Vegas. After we checked out of Mandalay Bay and had our luggage stored, we walked around and stumbled into the Four Seasons, which is encapsulated around the Mandalay ground. Their pool is right next to the Mandalay Beach separated by partition.<br><br>So we were killing time until it was time head back to McCarran.<br><br>PRESS is a lounge overlooking the pool area. It consists of a full bar and a coffee/espresso stand. You can make purchase of coffee/tea and pastries and sit at the lounge, or order cocktails from the bartender. PRESS have plug-ins to recharge your iPhone and iPod dock. There&#39;s complimentary wifi. We split our time between the cozy indoor lounge and the poolside wicker chairs outside. It&#39;s perfect for catching up with friends or just chilling, reading a book.<br><br>A cosmopolitan is just $12 here---yes, at the Four Seasons and service is impeccable. They turned on the mist outside and parts of the section have cushioned booths that sit up to 10. It&#39;s a gorgeous beautiful place hidden away from the Strip. I&#39;ll definitely return for drinks in the future.	1
Today&#39;s visit was terribly disappointing. The service was just unforgivable, and it really didn&#39;t need to be.<br><br>First, our server brought us cold coffee, which is odd but like no big deal. She was really busy too. It seemed like all of her tables were leaving at the same time. She was super frazzled, so it&#39;s like yeah, just bring fresh coffee whenever. But it seems like she just gave up on us after the coffee. Her tables left and she starting doing her side work, totally ignoring our table. She never came back to our table for condiments, milk for the coffee, to see if everything was cool. Plus, even though I totally understand things get stressful and busy, I witnessed her being quite ugly to another staff member. I overheard her complaining about the Scoutmob deal that everyone was using (um, hello! It&#39;s obviously bringing in biz if all your tables are using it!) Someone needs to let her know that serving isn&#39;t her calling. <br><br>Sad to say, probably will not be returning. The food is good, but not good enough to endure something that painfully awkward again.	0
Review #840! I can't say Lola is a Greek restaurant, more of a Greek-ish restaurant but it is quite good. The ingredients were perfectly fresh as in the other Tom Douglas joints but the flavors weren't quite as bold as I've liked in other Greek eateries. We had pita with assorted spreads- very nice but have to order more pita, what they bring is quite stingy, Seafood Tagine- nice fennel-y seafood in broth, Seared Chicken, Greek salad which was large and fresh but needed a higher proportion of kalamata olives and Squid Kebabs- must order! I will go back just to order this: spicy, sizzley, squiddy.  Mmmm.	0
After a night out and trying to find a good Raman place that was still open, we ended up at Tatsu (closes at 3am!). It&#39;s one of the more fancy Raman places I&#39;ve tried. You literally order your food on iPads stationed at the entrance and have the choice to pay there, get the receipt, wait to be seated and have your order brought out to you. The process was different and entertaining to do.<br><br>The waiters were nice and it all seems like a great place to eat until the food actually arrived. The presentation was okay just like every other Raman, just less of it. And for 10-12 dollars a bowl I&#39;d expect to have something other than just an egg in my bowl. The broth was plain with regular noodles! I also got the chashu rice bowl which came with a sprinkling of dried beef on top, not even kidding.<br><br>I really wanted to enjoy this place and hoped it could have been one of my late night eatery but the food was so mediocre. If you have ever tried any other Raman place, you&#39;d most likely avoid this one after trying it once. The only thing that saved it was the service and the to-go box and bag, it was cute.	0
a terrible experience. <br><br>I ordered the baked eggs. in any restaurant you go to, the eggs come runny with a soft yolk. my order came out (after 40 minutes) with three eggs, one with a medium cooked yolk, two that had hard yolks. I asked our server if this is the way it really comes out and he said yes. I told him I thought they would be runny since that&#39;s how most baked eggs dishes come out. he said if that&#39;s how I wanted it, I&#39;d need to specify when ordering and if I want it that way, to just say. I told him I&#39;d prefer runny yolks and asked for my dish to be remade. the yolks were so hard and even the whites were hard and dried out in some areas, pretty unappetizing. he said if I wanted the order remade I&#39;d have to pay for it. what? it&#39;s $9. it wont break your effing back to remake my egg dish. no freakin baked egg dish, unless its a frittata, is made so that it&#39;s completely set. it left a really bad taste in my mouth. the server never came by to ask how we were doing and he avoided my eye contact all night.<br><br>I ended up not even touching the dish because it was difficult to get past the hardened texture. he didn&#39;t even offer to comp my bill for the misunderstanding. <br><br>I will never visit this establishment ever again. poor service and extremely mediocre food. nobody at my table was impressed.	0
This review is weird... it started off as a three star review that has become a 5 star review... i couldn&#39;t edit out all my initial comments but.. here goes.. Loved the ambiance and manager was very nice for letting us in early for drinks since our reservation was made on open table where they hadn&#39;t updated the new opening hours. My bff was raving about the nitrogen cocktails she had read about online. She got the diamonds are forever and i got the buddhalicious... omg... the thing tasted like cough syrup initially.. . literally... i think the bartenders agreed actually.... anyway.... all in all the restaurant seemed to be more about presentation than quality... if ur looking for a place to take pictures... imagine disneyland... with no rides.... then ur in the right place... took some nice pics of my cough syrup but I&#39;d even have Dimetapp over the buddhaDisgusting anyday... mac n cheese was heavenly... luv luved it...Made w cheddar you can taste.. def come for the food... <br>update hostess and manager were very nice... manager was pretty awesome... came by and switched out the drink for me... probably update the drink too tho bff stopped me from describing it as cough syrup... But new drink tasted much better.. really good actually... diamonds drink wasnt bad either.. update to 5 stars...they brought around super cute bagel looking bread! Definitely coming back!	1
I love you, Toast. You are local, courteous, and perceptive. I don't think there is a single bad item on the menu. The staff are outstanding. You will love this place. Tons of beautiful people eating all around.Go Toast!!	1
Terrible service!! But great food. Appetizers came after entrees. Asked to cancel it but they said no bc it was almost done. Charged me for it anyways. Ugh. Coulda been 5 star but put me in such a bad mood bc they didn&#39;t really seem remorseful after all their mistakes. Whatever. If you eat here order takeout.	0
Omg! Love this place!!! Everything is sooo yummy!! Corn on a cob, k bbq taco, raw fish taco, maple chicken taco, and shrimp&pork shumai taco, & duck fat fries!!!!! Soooo good!!! And the highlight is michillada beer!!!! Sooo refreshing!!!!	1
Stopped by for a quick bite of something different. <br>Yummy home cooking at it&#39;s best! <br>Had three types of gorditas and fideo soup. Soup just like grandma&#39;s... ;-)<br>Gorditas are made of wheat flour and they are nice, thin, stuffed with the filling of your choice. :-)<br>The Horchata was just as good. Wish I had a bigger stomach for more than three!	1
Kind of heartbroken over the changes here - so much less comfortable, cozy and neighborhoody. Agree with the other reviewer who said it feels more commercial. New chef not as good as the previous one, either. The turkey burger used to be unbelievably good - think it&#39;s still the same basic recipe but was overcooked, cheese practically burnt, and it came on some kind of bizarre bright yellow bun that was frankly disgusting. The new hightop tables and booths are super uncomfortable, and I saw some older regulars giving them the side-eye, not so happy that they would have to climb up there instead of just sitting at a table. Another West Village favorite ruined.	0
I will make this quick. The food was beyond reproach. The server gave us some great suggestions and the atmosphere was great.	1
Authentic Taiwanese boba milk tea. Best place to get it in Miami. The ratio of tea to milk to sugar is perfect. The large size was $6 which is not bad. Oh and they have a chocolate flavor milk tea which you never see!!<br><br>The sandwich was very good as well, excellent flavor.	1
hmm, idunno why Perch only rates an average of 3.5. I'd say more like a 4. My friends and I were walking around downtown in search of a venue that had no cover, yet was still open at 1am. Thankfully, my friend knew downtown pretty well enough to know that Perch was one such place. The fact that we'd have to take an elevator up to the lounge was pretty cool, instantly brought back memories of Vegas lol while waiting for the second elevator, there was a cool, old-school piano and we were playing it as if no one was there :DOnce we were on the top floor, I was amazed with the room and the patio area in the back. And the view!! I was definitely in love, and this was even before bday shots and stuff! I definitely felt like it was an 'SF meets LA'-type of deal, which for me, is the best of both worlds!A friend of mine got me a bday drink (aww he's so sweet lol), and we went outside to sit on some chairs while admiring the breathtaking view of downtown. My other friends were sitting near a fireplace, which I didn't get to see, but I guess there is a fireplace on the rooftop!I didn't really pay much attention to the crowd around us, but the noise level around us was pretty average. The DJ was in the room so we were able to make conversation in the patio area (this is important to me since one of my pet peeves is attempting to talk over noise, which I cannot do that well and then the other person keeps going 'huh?' and like leaning in awkwardly...ugh :)The drinks were pretty good! Not sure which bday shot my friend got me but it was tropical and pretty to look at. Meanwhile, the cranberry vodka (my fav) my guy friend got me was average (I mean, how different can other cranberry vodkas be from one another? lol).At the end during closing, the bouncers could've been a little more nice and professional, but all in all we had a great time considering it was the last venue we went to for the night. It was a good way to end the night. I would definitely go back and stay longer!	1
WHOA! I didn't see that coming! They're food is good! I got some tacos and my friend the noodle salad. It's filling and delicious! Go here!	1
I dont usually do this.. But one bartender sure doesn&#39;t know how to deal with guests she just met for the first time. <br>Found a hair in my chicken sandwich that actually landed in my mouth.. smh. and the sandwich itself was a waste of my money. The Beer was great though no thanks to the establishment of course.	0
Another AYCE, yes.I like this place. Their salad is good, their service one of the friendliest.Meat quality above average.	1
Ordered Panang curry and the chicken was raw.<br><br>The taste of the curry was amazing until I got to my first bite of pink rubbery chicken then I had to hold back my vomit....<br><br>If the chicken had been thoroughly cooked it probably would&#39;ve been perfect. I would just rather not risk that experience again or bother risking salmonella/food poisoning. <br><br>I won&#39;t be back to say the least. If they make sure their meats are thoroughly cooked I&#39;m sure it tastes great. Just a risk you gotta take I suppose. I just personally can&#39;t stomach raw chicken.<br><br>Good luck.	0
My experience with this place is no bueno. Serving up an underdone sausage. And the cook had the nerve to tell me that there was nothing wrong it the meat. The center was totally cold while the outside was chard. Gross meat &amp; service.	0
Mmmmm. Really good pizza. The funghetto pizza is my favorite. Very addictive and I keep on coming back for more. <br><br>The pizzas are roman style and is very authentic according to my Italian friends.	1
Food selections for the AYCE hotpot is so limited and they don&#39;t have enough tables for small parties. My friend and I had to share a private room with 2 other girls and the ventilation was horrible. <br><br>Other than that the service was good but I won&#39;t be returning on my own free will and I don&#39;t even want to try the Korean BBQ which I smelled a lot of people burning their food. <br><br>Also the beef was super frozen which I dislike. <br><br>Hot pot in queens is way better with more food selections that come with the AYCE.	0
Had the NY steak. Wasnt good overall.<br><br>Potatoes were soggy. Coleslaw was pathetic. Steak was a-ok. A big portion but tastes so-so.<br><br>Tables and toilets were very dirty.<br><br>Carpark attendants at the open air carpark opposite the venue were extremely rude and stuck up. I would run them over the next time they display such rudeness to customers.<br><br>I went in with my car, and just asked politely how much did parking cost. When i decided to park on the street instead( as it was free) , they were very rude and asked me to get out with horrible body language.	0
Good service and nice space BUT seriously small portions! Be prepared to drop around $150 for 2 people and still feel a little hungry. Entrees were appetizer size. Food was nothing special. Won&#39;t be back.	0
O M G THIS PLACE IS MIND BLOWING.	1
If you want the Cuban experience I recommend you visit. You can buy all types of authentic Cuban food (roasted pork, moros, chicharrones, etc). Each meal is enough food for at least two people if not three, because their portions are immense. <br><br>I stop in from time to time only for some coco frio so I can be healthy and drink pure coconut juice. Each coconut is $2. <br><br>Another great tip is if you have a holiday gathering where someone needs to take the roasted pork you should definitely buy it from Palacio de los Jugos. Also, try their juices (lots of added sugar) but it is what made this place a landmark. My favorite is the watermelon juice. <br><br>They deserve 4 stars only on the basis of authenticity because when you visit this place it can be a big culture shock. Explore and visit!	1
CASH ONLY.I really just didn't like the burger--the relish killed it. No shakes (my fave part of a burger/fry sitch), and I thought it was bloody expensive. Parking is a bitch, and I KNEW that greasy-spoon smell infiltrated every fiber of my clothes during our 20-minute stay.Fries are kick-ass, though!	0
Do they use tons of MSG? The food has that over the top delicious flavor in the first couple of bites.... Thenyou realize how much oil they use the taste satisfaction you initially felt goes away. They also need to learn and teach their staff what good customer service means because they don't have a clue. I tried calling in for take out twice in the same evening they put me on hold twice for at least 10 minutes before I hung up. I called back a 3rd time and again put me on hold. While on hold I decided to walk to the restaurant to see what was really going on. I walk in and the person at the register is ringing up bill ( normal job duties) nothing overwhelming. I ask to speak to a manager and said I am still on hold -it had been 15 minutes- and I am here why are you treating you customers so horribly? I haven't been back since.	0
Wonderful place!  They have a WIDE selection of Vodka, hence their moniker Vodkatorium. Tito's Vodka from Texas is highly recommended.	0
This restaurant exceeded my expectations.	1
The food is delicious and the service is great. It is BYOB which is always a bonus. The fried chicken and waffles were the best I&#39;ve ever had!	1
Went there with a group of friends. Was ok but on vacation I strive for better than ok. Prices were reasonable so this is by no means a bad review just a little under satisfied. Food lacked flavor as well. Would be a great lunch place if they were open for Lunch.	0
Had the grossest dinner I&#39;ve had in a while at this place. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve had to pick around my food to avoid the gross bits, so I was genuinely shocked to find something so disgusting on my plate at Cafe Cluny. Whatever you do, don&#39;t order the pasta. Seems quite strange that for a French restaurant, everyone was eating burgers and fries - really tells you something about the rest of their menu. One to avoid.	0
Best. Sandwiches. Ever.	1
The Al Pastor and Fish tacos are definitely better than Asada/Carnitas. It&#39;s missing the perfect sauce to cap it off as a great baja taco. It&#39;s nice to have beer to go with it. Overall, the tacos are better than your average, but not as good as a great authentic truck taco.	1
I have been here a handful of times and always have a great time. I love the music and general ambiance of the place and the severs have always been very friendly.<br><br>I generally order from the prix fixe which is a great deal. The goat cheese fondue is amazing, the gnocchi is delicious, the pork cutlet entree is incredible, and the desserts are delicious as well. They have great sangria and other drinks. Honestly, I don&#39;t think I have ever had food here that I didn&#39;t love. <br><br>I have been here for my birthday and for other birthdays and they always bring out this giant plastic cake with huge sparklers on it to blow out which is very fun. <br><br>This is definitely a place for a younger crowd. If i lived in the area i would come here more often, but even if you do not live near by it is worth the drive to check out. <br><br>Like most areas of LA, parking can be difficult and I would recommend making a reservation if you have a group.<br><br>Overall, this place has good food and a great vibe. I would recommend coming here with friends, with family, or even on a date as they have some intimate booths with curtains on them.	1
The Perch is absolutely beautiful. The view is amazing, the way they decorated along with the arrangement of furniture is amazing, and there's a live band! I am usually annoyed with live bands but its not distracting music, its just great conversation/food eating music. It is a bit pricey, but you're paying for the experience.	1
The ambiance could definitely use some TLC. It has a donut shop feeling to it. Other than that, everything was awesome! Dave himself was helping us grill our meat. We loved having the ability to go up to the refrigerators to pick out what we wanted. We didn&#39;t feel pressured and it was a fun experience for everyone involved.	1
Annie's is a hidden gem located near 215 and Valle Verde.  The food and service were excellent!	1
I think the pastries in the front are disappointing. I've been here several times for brunch and once for dinner. The items on the brunch menu were excellent. Tasty food and attentive service. A+	0
2 stars for mediocre food. <br>1 star for service. <br><br>When you spend $50 including tip when we weren&#39;t even seated. Not knowing what to expect, I really wanted my money back. <br><br>Clearly the waitress was all different when bringing out the dishes. And one couldn&#39;t even recall what we ordered and kept asking irrelevant questions. Kept asking and bringing the wrong food and they gave us a table next to the door, and that table was amazingly wobbly and we ate our entire dinner shaking profusely and when we were fed up with the poor service. The waitress finally realized the damn table was wobbly and fixed it when we were done. This is poor service and management I had ever experienced. The atmosphere is really loud so don&#39;t expect to have a decent conversation with your partner unless you want to scream for an hour. <br><br>The damn waitress was unapologetic and she was really clueless about how to serve and make her damn customers leave the damn place satisfied. I will never come back even if you paid me to.	0
I love this place. I came across it by walking on the side walk and letting my curiosity take me down the narrow walkway glittered with small lights. We ordered some grub and some cold libations. It&#39;s a pretty mellow spot, at least it has been the past 4 times I&#39;ve been there. Oh, did a mention they have a good beer selection? They do.	1
The shift lead was such a disappointment. He is the sole reason that I can&#39;t give my recent experience here, a full five stars. And God knows how much I really really really wanted to.<br><br>We celebrated my sister&#39;s 25th here with such high hopes of a flawless evening. I&#39;ve even had this spot bookmarked for a quite a while.<br><br>Let&#39;s start from the beginning.<br>Valet is $5. It&#39;s worth it. My car purs like a kitten, so make sure the valet guy is aware that you are leaving the car on for him....or he&#39;ll make you cringe by turning the ignition on unnecessarily. Upon entrance, you&#39;ll need to catch your breath. It&#39;s a beautiful, romantic, tropical, vintage, eyegasm. It&#39;s art deco, Swiss Family Robinson, and the Belle Epoque, all sexily smashed together in a bowl of Silverlake, Ca. Not a hipster/scenester in sight. It&#39;s truly the definition of a hidden gem.<br><br>To the left is the bar. And a large one at that. The list of libations is also quite large and service is quick. At the bar I noticed something. Yes, it was a crazy busy Saturday night, but these employees don&#39;t seem to smile. Our waitress in the dining room also exhibited the same lack of sparkle I would have loved to have experienced at a restaurant so beautifully designed. It would have been the cherry on top.<br><br>The menu is small. It allowed us to really hone in on what our palates really felt like enjoying for the evening. I had the kale salad; a surprising and memorable large portion of kale, breadcrumbs, pickled grapes, almonds, and parmesean cheese. It was so delicious, I shared my plate with half the table. I also tried the octopus. Despite being fried, it&#39;s delicate taste was not lost. Whatever you choose to eat here will be delicious and well prepared. No points lost on that note.<br><br>My problem: It took over 40 minutes for our entrees to come out. I fully understand that for a large party, the kitchen usually waits for all of the plates to be prepared before serving. BUT...I am also fully aware of the need for your waitress to address your table regarding the wait time. Does it make sense to leave your table in limbo, staring at each other? Of course, we kept ourselves occupied, but still!<br>So my father goes up to the &#39;shift lead&#39; to question what the hold up was, and the guy does this restaurant a complete disservice. He disrespects a patron and his family by answering in such an egregious way, that my father simply stops him mid sentence and demands to speak to the owner of the establishment.<br><br>The owner promptly reveals himself and immediately, my father realizes this is a Frenchman. Long story short, my father and the owner were able to converse in French, the problem was solved, and our entrees were delivered hot and delicious. At the end of our meal, my sister was presented with the most silky chocolate ganache cake by the owner himself. With a lit candle! On the house.<br><br>That! My people, is how you do it!! That! Is how you solve a problem. That! Is how you appease a disgruntled customer. The customer is not interested in your song and dance. I don&#39;t care about A B and/or C. I just wanna know where my waitress/food is. Thank you Sir for quickly rectifying our situation. The way in which you did showed us that you care about your business and you care about how your patrons feel.<br><br>Merci Beaucoup!<br><br>p.s.,<br>Our bus man (not busboy) was absolutely on top of his game. He needs to be promoted. Take note waitress...he was an A++ :)	1
It really says something when, on a workday, I get to down pricey margaritas (that's plural) with lunch and don't have to pick up the check--yet I still end up giving a restaurant something of a pan. And here I am giving Colibri a reluctant two stars--it really deserves about 2.5 stars. My third trip to this Union Square Mexican bistro--a Friday at lunch--was by far the least impressive, and marks for me a downward trajectory for the restaurant that I once recommended to friends when they were in the surrounding area.The very small portions of improperly cooked meat dishes (beef ordered medium must never manifest itself as bloody, red and cool to the touch, and carnitas should never be bone-dry and under-flavored) were not quite offset by the fantastic tableside guacamole with fresh, hot tortillas. If we had only had margaritas and guacamole, this review would be much better--alas, we ordered food.And although the table service was good, our reservation apparently didn't amount to much--we had to actively push for a better table, which they reluctantly gave us. I mean, hey--we're four coworkers looking to chug some premium tequila from their extensive list over a two-hour "working lunch"--don't put us in the freakin' streetfront window. We're not tourists. I'm not sure I will return.	0
We went to The Old Clam House for lunch. Parking was scarce. We discovered a tiny lot behind the restaurant and parked in front of their trash bins. The smell was awful and right behind our car was a dead, decaying rat. Obese flies (and probably blind) smacked into our faces left and right.We expected the restaurant to be busier since we were told to make a reservation. We came in around 3:30pm (on a Thursday) and the restaurant had only 3 tables and a few patrons at the bar. We seated ourselves and a kitchen staff/bus-staff brought out two shot glasses of overly salty seafood broth, cold bread, and piss-yellow, dry, hard butter.We ordered and presented our Groupons: $17 for a whole 2lb crab or regular cut prime rib. We got both and a side of their "Mashed Yukon Potato and Zucchini," Italian Wild Strawberry Cheesecake, and a Coke. The other stuff amounted to about $18. With tips and everything, we spent over $60 and I really wish that $60 was spent elsewhere.Service was ok; not great, not bad. The people were friendly. I would've really appreciated it if our server had told me that the prime rib came with a side of their "potato" already so we wouldn't have ordered another side of their "potato" which we never touched. My boyfriend ordered the crab and as he said, "it's not very good." My boyfriend is not that picky with his crab. Freshly steamed crab is his favorite. No seasoning required. So for him to say the crab was no good, I'm guessing it wasn't very fresh. It did come out really fast, like less than 10 minutes. We've steamed crabs at home and it takes longer than 10 minutes.The prime rib came with 6 pieces of their "Smushed Dutch Creamer Potato." The steak was huge. It was at least 20oz. BUT there was more fat than meat. I lopped off all the fat and the portion of steak compared to fat was pathetic (like less than half). It tasted fine, I guess. The potatoes looked like they got stepped on. I kid you not. I've never had "Dutch" potatoes and I am not making fun of the Dutch. Maybe that's just The Old Clam House's interpretation of that dish. Seriously, what did those poor petite potatoes do to you? They were served with some sour cream on the side. Flavorless and very greasy.The "Mashed Yukon Potato and Zucchini" came out to be exactly like the "Smushed Dutch Creamer Potato." Six pieces for $5.95. A buck for a tiny stepped-on potato!? And I don't know why I got more stepped-on potatoes. I thought I was getting mashed potato. They gave us two menus and one menu had "Mashed..." and the other had "Smushed..." I don't know.The cheesecake could have been better. A sliver of a four-layer cake with alternating yellow cake and cream cheese topped with a strawberry/raspberry compote jelly. The cream cheese was light and airy but still creamy. I liked the cake instead of the usual graham cracker crust but the cake was really wet. Not worth $7.95.	0
Best ice cream in Seattle if not on the west coast. Amazing flavors. Warm friendly place and people. Go there now.	1
I&#39;m NOT a fan of this location! Last Sunday, I invited several friends to celebrate my 32nd birthday at Segafredo&#39;s simply because i had never been there, and we all live in brickell including some of my triathlon teammates. First of all, the waiter seemed like he was still high from the night before, he forgot my drink (the birthday girl!!!) and forgot my friend&#39;s order twice! it was a disaster. It took the waiter close to 30 minutes to simply bring the drinks so we can do the first &#34;toast&#34; of the evening. Then my friends refused for me to get involved in a huge mixup that the waiters and manager had done with our bill (Laura D. wrote an extensive review on that one) they wanted me to be completely oblivious to Segafredo&#39;s lack of professional service and they didn&#39;t want THAT to ruin my birthday.. What a huge SHAME!! I could run this place better than they do! They are in the middle of Brickell and should be providing TOP NOTCH BRICKELL SERVICE and they FAILED.. I would go to Crazy about You instead!!! and i should have done that for my birthday!	0
Great lunch spot. Fast service. The atmosphere is nice for a lunch time crowd, not to busy.	1
There aren&#39;t words to describe my unending love for Canter&#39;s Fairfax and their Pastrami Reuben. Must eat it with a schmear of Russian dressing.	1
I know it's hard to stand out when you are making Italian food. I do not expect too much considering that at times it does tend to all taste the same. I just ask that the flavors are all there to really compliment each other. The only dish that I enjoyed was the roasted beets. My spaghetti dish was average and can't really recall if I really enjoyed it or not. The wine was very average as well. This place is in a very cute spot and like one of my fellow yelpers said, maybe this place will grow on me...	0
The best chops I&#39;ve ever had! Friendly staff, great service, great food, great vibe, and GREAT sauces! A+	1
So I&#39;ve been seeing this place on the home page of Yelp because I work pretty close to this place so I finally went and tried it.<br><br>The layout is very strange... You have to go in and order from this small room (actually the room/unit is pretty big but most of the space is used for the kitchen) and I felt super claustrophobic and rushed to order because the guy is just staring at you while you&#39;re trying to decide what to eat from a very limited selective menu (grilled cheese, hot dogs &amp; fries/tater tots) but I mean I&#39;m very indecisive so please... just give me some time.<br><br>Anyways the guy&#39;s actually pretty nice and but he tries to sell you everything on the menu if you go there with more than one person. And we take his word (I was actually trying to go with recommendations from other yelp reviewers) and try a variety of things. We get the chicken adobo grilled cheese, pork adobo grilled cheese, belly &amp; snout hot dog? &amp; sisig tater tots.<br><br>After ordering, you gotta walk out and walk to another place to sit down.. like I said, very strange layout... I&#39;m waiting for the food, the place is pretty tiny, and you can literally hear everyone&#39;s conversations because the place is pretty small. I guess it could get a little awkward if you&#39;re there with people you&#39;re not very close with.<br><br>Food finally comes out and I&#39;m very disappointed. Not much flavor, and left me with a very garlic-y taste the whole day. I honestly don&#39;t even remember tasting anything but the super buttery &amp; crispy bread for the grilled cheese and straight fried garlic.<br><br>Trying this place once is good enough for me. Really don&#39;t need to come here more than once.	0
I think if you've been to Jamaica/the Caribbean (provided you didn't just eat at resorts), you'll appreciate this place. As we sat waiting for food, my husband remarked that it felt so much like being in Honduras. We walked in and the woman barely greeted us, but was super friendly. We sat ourselves and she disappeared. We grabbed our own beers. Totally okay (apparently, from reviews, to be expected). Food orders were taken, and we waited. Even though we were the only people eating. The food was brought out and was amazing.	0
Boooooring! Chile relleno was flavorless. Cornbread was wet and tasteless. Pork trio was both over- and under-spiced, and the beans were hella-salty. Not worth the money.	0
Randomly stopped in Madison on a cross country trip. I had been to Madison once before to visit a friend in college and I vaguely recall a beer and brat drunken haze. Now beyond our college years, my friend and I decided we wanted to treat ourselves to something nice so we headed for State street and walked around until something peaked our interest. We had been driving for 15 hours and were really hungry and in need of some good beverages. We came across Paul's and couldn't have asked for a better experience. It is a bit on the upscale side and we were pretty ragged looking, but that didn't seem to be a problem. Our waiter James was awesome and he was really funny and helpful with the menu. We had no idea what to expect and ended up ordering a few different plates as well as a couple cocktails. Everything was really good and the prices weren't bad either for the high quality of food you're getting. Would recommend this place to anyone heading towards Madison.	1
I brought takeout from this restaurant for a client lunch this week. Overall the food was average at best. I sampled the Pad Thai Cashew Chicken Swimming Rama Jungle Curry and the Phad Pug. By far my favorite was the Jungle Curry. My least favorite was the Swimming Rama and pales in comparison to that served up by Pen Thai in Bothell. Also I recommend take out as the staff was somewhat unfriendly and not very accommodating.	0
We live locally and had dined at Canaletto before when we had family visiting Las Vegas. So when we had company visiting again we decided to make reservations at Canaletto again. It's in such a fun location ... inside the square at the Venetian. The opera singers in the square, the decor, the lighting make it such a special destination.While we thoroughly enjoyed our first visit to Canaletto this one was disappointing. For starters, the server who first provided us with menus had a food stain very visible on the label of his jacket. Definitely a turnoff. As far as the food, the reviews were mixed among our party of four. Whoever ordered pasta dishes loved the sauces. The caesar salads which two of us ordered as a first course were ice cold ... as though the lettuce was just taken out of the freezer. Barely edible. Also the grilled salmon entree was very average, almost tasteless. Perhaps because they serve so many tourists who never return again the restaurant management just isn't that attentive.	0
Go here. If you&#39;re within 20 miles of this place, go.<br><br>Reason one: Apple Pan has survived intact and unchanged in West LA for 60 years. It&#39;s like a friggin&#39; time machine. That alone is worth the price of admission. Things in WLA don&#39;t survive this long due to the mindless loyalty of the local blue collar residents (because there are none). <br><br>Reason two: The menu and the food are also from a time warp- in a good way. Nobody messed with the formula or recipes over the years and now it seems like a gimmick. Gimmicks are fine sometimes, but Apple Pan is not one of them. <br><br>And please, don&#39;t put this (or any historic restaurant) in the race for &#34;best&#34; whatever in town. Honestly, are you comparing nouveau fare like Father&#39;s Office burgers (which I like) to the stuff your grampa used to eat back in the day? (when he had teeth)	1
Not only is the food amazing the service is outstanding and on Monday Nights starting at 6PM they host FREE poker tournaments by the Nevada Poker League. Great food and service and poker tournaments how can you beat this deal?	1
Was very annoyed of having to drive all the way downtown from Sherman Oaks for business lunch at Perch, but it ended up being the highlight of my day! The location, the view, the vibe, the service, the FOOD...next time you need a break and an experience, do yourself a favor, make the pilgrimage - you won't be disappointed. Treat yourself to something special. P.S. See if you can get Colin to be your server, the man is a real pro, and just a joy to deal with.	1
Was advised to come here. A little disappointed. Steak wasn&#39;t great. I always get a rib-eye cooked med/rare. It came out a little overcooked. For the price and atmosphere I expected much better.	0
Cuban sandwich isn&#39;t nice at all. They appear to have used sweet pickles and it is far too sweet. The other plates taste alright but far too small	0
The primary reason I come here is for Robert as pizza! It&#39;s absolutely delicious and the perfect size.<br>They come twice a year at this Location and at Madison sq eats aswell! <br>I&#39;ve tried a couple different vendors which were a miss - canolis and vegetarian meat balls - both were bad	1
Fresh sushi, great service, and great prices. Now how can you beat that. You get the best service and the food comes out faster at the bar. The sushi chef&#39;s are more hands on with you at the bar and they are very accommodating. Bottom line eat at the bar! :)<br><br>A must try and a keep coming back for more kind of place!	1
Salty...Korean twist on dishes. Good food esp. the tuna on rice. Potato pancake was great. Good use of sunchoke throughout.	1
Great food friendly staff! Thank god we got there early because business picked up and there wasn&#39;t enough seating for everyone but the owner was more than accommodating and concerned about everyone! The food is amazing and well worth it! I haven&#39;t taken my family of four out for under $40 and left stuffed! that&#39;s Including TNT Donut! We even bought our own beer next door and our waiter kept it cold while we ate! I can&#39;t wait to go back the next time we break our diet!	1
Omar is the man and the food is terrific! If you don&#39;t know Omar or any of the tacos you should go soon! <br><br>The Japanese short rib taco is unreal and so is the el pastor and even the samurai. The truffle fries are great and if you go Phil&#39;s way you won&#39;t be disappointed.<br><br>I will definitely be going back for years to come. <br><br>Thank you for the great meals and awesome hospitality. <br><br>Cheers	1
Great drinks. HORRIBLE service. I get it, it's LA on a busy Sunday and I look 18. But I couldn't even get the table cleaned from the previous patrons. It took over a reasonable time to place an order, get our drinks and we tried several times to flag someone down to even get our check. I'm stunned on how poor the service is here. But I guess when you are attached to LACMA you really don't have to worry about customer service.	0
I&#39;ve eaten at MG three times. The first time it was OK., the second not great and the third terrible. Three strikes you&#39;re out. Waste of money and calories. Steak totally fatty, chicken barely cooked. Service was good and hostess very sweet.	0
OpenTable said the place had no availability within 2.5 hours of my requested reservation time so I opted to call in and scored a table on a thirsty Thursday night and specifically requested for outdoor dining.<br><br>Although the entire party didn&#39;t show up on time, our reservation was honored as soon as most of us arrived. We just had to wait at the bar before getting seated.<br><br>Myself and two others in our party ordered the Little Bunny Frou Frou which was rabbit ravioli. I&#39;ve never had rabbit meat but since it was recommended by our waiter and fellow Yelpers, I gave it a go. It was DELIGHTFULLY TASTY! I also highly recommend the delicious truffle fries. <br><br>My friends (Bostonians and Angelenos) and guests thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and views of DTLA although I don&#39;t think they&#39;re the most spectacular. The pro&#39;s: It wasn&#39;t crowded and there were no lines up the stairwell to the rooftop. Although it got chilly dining outdoors, we were surrounded by headlamps and had wine and cocktails that kept us toasty.<br><br>3 stars for dining service<br>5 stars for the food<br>3.5 stars for the ambience (on a Thursday evening) and view	1
This was our best meal for the week in the Venetian.	1
Soda watered down!Service is okay..But the chicken was bomb :)The garlic fried chicken was perfectly crispy and the spicy one I got was so spicy but I switched off from garlic chicken and spicy chicken and they somehow married together very well.I love the cubed pickled radish.. It compliments the chicken. YummmCan't wait to go to LA again and stop by some Kyochon Chicken.	1
I've heard such good things about this place but we had a meal there a couple weeks ago and were not impressed. I had the garlic chicken and it was terrible. The garlic was so overpowering and the rest of the dish had no taste. My sister had the pumpkin curry and that wasn't much better. You could taste the heat of the spice but there really wasn't a good balance of flavors. Disappointed considering what we have heard.	0
This is brilliant. I love this bar and the people here. Everyone is chill and fun and well, awesome. Great food, cocktails that focus on deliciousness over flash and a menu that&#39;s tasty and varied. So happy to have this bar, managed by the cool and hilarious Blerim in Hollywood.	1
We had a window seat overlooking the strip. Absolutely gorgeous!!! Service was the best, and the food was even better!!! Probably the best meal I've ever had!! Lobster was perfect, and so was the filet. I will go back for sure!!	1
I love this place! I'm honestly so sick of Birds, and this place is such a refreshing and delightful addition to that area. They fit right in with the scene, and apparently the owners are connected to Oaks Gourmet as well, which makes perfect sense. The blue cheese tater tots and clam chowder were ridiculously good. The tastings are really fun and they have a good selection of beer on tap. I can't wait to try more of the foods on the menu, they look innovative and delicious!I can't wait to go back!	1
Pros: Misty spray from outdoor fans. <br><br>Cons: Steaks &amp; pasta isn&#39;t anything to rave about. Isn&#39;t a clear delineation between busboys &amp; waiters.	0
It was my first time eating here and I decided to have a cheese tamale and horchata. The tamale was very warm and delicious. Overall the meal was very delicious and exceeded my expectations. The service and atmosphere were also very good.	1
Went in feeling excited, left feeling disappointed.<br><br>The service wasn&#39;t great, I&#39;d say it was barely decent. I had mentioned to my server it was my first time here and she did not even take the time to explain or recommend anything on the menu. Being a server myself, I found that pretty rude. Also, there was this one server or busser that kept coming by to take our bowls/plates &amp; silverware when we were clearly not finished with it. He even took me &amp; my friends napkins which we were obviously using throughout our meal. I honestly did not understand why he took all our silverware when there was still food on our table LOL I had high hopes for this place, I really did.. but the service just killed it for me.	0
been going here since high school (that's forever)!The food here is AWESOME!Always a very casual place to go any time.The place did change though-the service isn't as fun and personal as it used to be and the people who come here are totally emo and wannabes.Not the same place when locals used to come but nevertheless the food is still great. I only come by twice a year now.	1
Came for brunch when I was visiting Chicago. The food was very good. The portion was big with reasonable price. I liked the relaxing atmosphere a lot. The staff were very nice as well!	1
Unfortunately the food was very disappointing. We had the short rib, sirloin cap, kennebec fries and shaved brussels sprouts. The food was just OK (very salty) and definitely overpriced. The only thing we did thoroughly enjoy was the smoke stack cocktail. Glad I tried this place but I won&#39;t be back.	0
Good table attentive staff delicious baked goods bacon eggs benedict and omelette. Success.	1
I've been looking for a good xiaolongbao place and was recommend to this restaurant. When you walk into the restaurant, you definitely smell the xiaolongbao which is a good sign but...when I took a bite of it, I just thought it was so-so. I've definitely had better. The service needs some work too.	0
Working in the suburbs and taking transit to work, my options for lunch are limited to a handful of places within walking distance, so it gets repetitive... and I rarely even go out for lunch. So it was with joy a few years ago that I was downtown for a meeting and happened upon something called Brown Bag Lunch Truck while checking out the food truck scene. I cried a little when I&#39;d finished because there was no more to be had- I was that impressed with the flavor combinations. I followed the truck on social media hoping in vain for another chance encounter. It never happened but through the Facebook feed found out about BBLT&#39;s new wheel-less brother, smalls. AMEN!<br>I&#39;ve since carried out three times and am a huge fan. I could eat a dump truck full of their garlic rice and brisket. The elotes made me want to sing. Super cool staff, everything I&#39;ve eaten has been outstanding, and it&#39;s on my way home. This is going to work out rather well.	1
1 star because I came here and wanted to meet a couple friends. I had been here many times prior with no issues about seating but their seating system is TERRIBLE and forced me and my friends to leave and go to RAMEN SORA. <br><br>Let me explain: They will NOT seat you unless your full party is present. Okay I get that-- that&#39;s fine. But my friend called and said she was going to be 30 min late and to go ahead and start eating and she would join us. <br><br>WELL.. That is NOT allowed at Monta. They follow strict rules and would rather have you LEAVE than seat you at a table (that seats four people) and have your remaining party join you. <br><br>SO in essence, if you&#39;re seated at a table with 2 extra seats you CANNOT have anyone come in and sit down and join you. <br><br>I was told that my friend would have to re-check in and wait. (?? that doesn&#39;t even make sense) <br><br>SORRY MONTA, but the hassle is definitely not worth it. I&#39;d rather get my fill ELSEWHERE. I left immediately after they didn&#39;t negotiate seating. <br><br>-angry yelper.	0
Yes! My boyfriend and I went to Emily last night and it was fantastic. We got the Colony and the Lady Pizza Girl at the recommendation of other Yelpers, and they were both tasty and interesting. I had never had honey on pizza before, and it&#39;s definitely something I&#39;ll be trying at home in the near future! The two pizzas were enough for our meal and we still had some left over for lunch today.<br><br>The service was wonderful, and a woman named Emily (maybe the owner?) checked in on us a couple of times to see that we were doing alright. The decor was nice, and the selection of music was also fantastic. <br><br>The place is a little pricey, but it was worth it for the awesome pizza and the cozy atmosphere.	1
This place has to be one of my favorite sushi place in LA. Reasonable pricing for quality food. My husband and I always get the toro($10), amaebi($10), uni($10), and scallop($8) nigiri and it is always delicious and super fresh. The service is also always very quick, efficient and friendly.<br><br>Before we started coming here we always went to Komasa, and the biggest difference for me is the quality of the preparation and the personal connection with the sushi chief. Unlike Komasa which only has one sushi chief every time we go Oomasa has 3 and they each have their own section; therefore, your food is prepared properly and your sushi does not fall apart when you pick them up (this has happened many times with Komasa.<br><br>Some of the must haves: clam miso soup, raw oyster with ponzu sauce, the 4 types of sushi mentioned above and unagi nigiri (eel, and they BBQ the eel as you order them. it is melt in your month goodness)	1
Too bad if you&#39;re not Korean..you won&#39;t get neither good service or service. <br>Food is average by the way.	0
I checked out Urban Ramen a couple of weeks ago after a night of comedy over at Meltdown Comics which is in walking distance of. I haven't ever had "fancy ramen" before aka the non Cup O'Noodle variety but my dining partner had and we checked this place out.The wait staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Our server made a point of explaining what ramen is in their context and recommended one for me to try based on what I liked. He recommended the spicy tonkotsu ramen with an egg and it was awesome - I added chili paste because I like a lot of spice, so it was a little mellower than I was expecting but still good. I got the thick noodles, but tried my partner's thin noodles and would get those next time. It was good, inexpensive relatively with good service and we could chat in the space so it wasnt too noisy. Would definitely visit again!	1
nice location but worst service ever. We had to ask for our waiter several times after waiting over an hour and then he blamed it on having to take a break.	0
The &#34;end-less gnocchi&#34; on the 29th is a joke at this place. We thought it would be the standard order a plate at a time until you&#39;re done set-up. Silly us. The way it actually works here is you wait for a guy to bring out a single plate of gnocchi from the kitchen and walk around to everyone in the restaurant giving them each a pre-allocated single spoon-full of gnocchi. You don&#39;t even get to choose which kind of sauce you&#39;d like. Instead, they have a series of 6 pre-made sauces that rotate and if you don&#39;t like it, you just have to wait another 15 minutes for your next spoon of gnocchi. After 45 minutes and barely having eaten anything, we requested the remaining few pieces of gnocchi at the end of one round. The server mumbled something about having to &#39;check and see&#39; and walked away. We looked over at the kitchen in disbelief and saw the server eating the rest of the gnocchi himself, straight from the serving plate!<br><br>$15/person and 1.5 Hr waiting time...NOT worth it!!	0
Loved every aspect of this meal. Food &amp; service were top notch. The secondary dining room felt a bit under-designed, not completed. I'd request to sit in the main room.The meat? Untouchable. Perfection.	1
This is for dinner. A couple friends and I shared about 8 or so plates. Everything was amazing - the addictive cabbage and the tofu were standouts to me. If you get dessert, get the azuki bean - MIND BLOWN.<br><br>A restaurant can have amazing food but what makes me want to come back to a place is the service that comes with that amazing food. The owner, who was our server that night, took the time to explain each dish. He explained how in Japan, guests judge your restaurant on how good you can prepare cabbage. He told us about how the tofu was prepared 2 days before serving that night. And he told us about Izakaya&#39;s story. Never had I felt more connected to what I was eating and never had I felt more connected to a restaurant&#39;s story - it&#39;s a great one. And I think it made the food that much better.<br><br>I&#39;m definitely coming back again and again and again.	1
Delicious fare, made fresh when you order. Good prices, and very friendly owners.	1
A unique experience indeed but the dishes often taste so strange it is difficult to enjoy them as a good meal rather simply as an interesting experience.	0
I'm down with LA Cafe. Yes, it's expensive and sometimes a little slow, BUT it also delivers and it's the only thing open that serves real food in that neighborhood late at night without dropping a hundred bucks at nearby restaurants. The farmers salad is good. The croissants are my favorite croissant. The hippy rice crispie is expensive but I really love it.Look, the only down side is it's expensive. But it's so damned convenient and the food really is good.	1
Ordered a lot of food, all bland. Even worse, terrible service. Wasn't even a busy night, but I had to ask my waitress for water three times. Plus we ordered her recommendations, yet she never asked how our food was. Bianca verde and mushroom pizzas especially bland. Polenta dish, not good. Don't believe the hype. WASTE OF MONEY, go somewhere else.	0
Surely this place is a gem. With a very warming atmosphere and a polite staff, it definitely sets up a very welcoming and good vibe. <br><br>The menu is succinct, so if you&#39;re looking for a giant ensemble to order from, En Hakkore is not the best choice for such. I ordered the sashimi-bap and my friend have the mega kimbap roll. Both undoubtedly were delicious. I truly enjoyed the overall dining experience here and loved the fact the their selection of teas were more than a simple green or black. <br><br>Price wise, it was reasonable for what was offered, and I do recommend bringing a date here or someone you wanna impress. Because it really is just a great place for that vibe. <br><br>Not ideal for the child&#39;s palate. <br><br>I would definitely return here nonetheless.	1
&#34;Game On&#34;<br><br>I played tic tac toe with the waitress, i won. <br><br>then she wanted to play hangman.<br><br>i won that too!<br><br>My friend Tarik who&#39;s a foodie, suggested we try this place that only serves Steak Frites! <br><br>I won again, because, I love Steak Frites.<br><br>you&#39;d never know this place was there, at least i never noticed, and i drive down Melrose all the time. <br><br>But i&#39;m glad i know it&#39;s there now, and i will most definitely go again.<br><br>why? because i love Tic Tac Toe, Hangman, and Steak Frites.	1
15 bucks for a 12oz. draft of Estralla ? Its the Budwiser of Spain. Are you F&#39;in kidding me.	0
I love Apple Pan when I'm craving a good ol' fashioned cheeseburger and fries. Or a slice of pie a la mode. Simple, fast service and satisfying food every time. I'm a hickory burger girl- love the hickory sauce. They're fries are nothing special, but you almost need them with the burger, unless of course you order pie! I sort of wish they had shakes, but I guess that would be too much of a good thing. Go at an odd hour so you don't have to awkwardly stand behind people as they eat and so you can score parking in back, otherwise that neighborhood is a bitch to park in. Great for after a movie at the Landmark 'cause they're open till 12am weeknights and 1am weekends!	1
If you want to be spoiled, go here.  It doesn't matter if you're an executive in a suit, a secretary or tourists around town, they treat you impeccably.  It's an old school steakhouse atmosphere, with dark wood, portraits and long white tablecloths, but the staff is approachable, engaging and humorous.  I love it from the second they offer to check my coat to the multiple wishes of have a good day as we exit. The food lives up to the service.  The soups are hot, silky and delicious, the salads bright and freshly dressed, the steaks seared to a crust on the outside and a perfect temp on the inside.  It's a shame I'm so full I don't ever make it to dessert.  I'm sure that would be glorious too. I look forward to every visit here and have never walked away disappointed.  Good job, Jimmy.	0
Just came back from the restaurant that we had to wait almost 2 months.It was very interesting experience. But I&#39;m still hungry..... As most you know that you don&#39;t know what you get until they serve you. Even on the menu it doesn&#39;t explain much. Most of the meal was one bite dish. Food was definitely good but did it worth $135? I would say &#34;NO&#34; it because I still am hungry after the meal. The quality was great. Most of the meal was seafood. You can tell that they are using very fresh fish. <br><br>We brought both red and white wine. We finished both. It&#39;s great that they are BYOB. The biggest complaint I have is the desert. They served us sorbet and ice cream. How can they serve 2 cold desert? Is it sort of common sense in the cooking world that if you serve cold desert, you serve warm (baked) desert for the next? I was very satisfied until the desert came. No coffee, nothing.<br><br>Like I said before, it was a good experience. I&#39;d not probably going back there anytime soon.	1
Wasn&#39;t too impressed. Especially given people&#39;s rave review and comments. The food is good and the service is fine but isn&#39;t amazing or anything. It is a like more authentic Johnny Rockets without being too kitschy or commercial. Everyone should go to this landmark at least once if only to say that they have been there.	1
One star is only for the decor of a Chinese noodle restaurant. Don&#39;t be fooled by the high ratings of this restaurant like my family did. <br><br>** ONLY EAT HERE IF THIS IS THE LAAAAST PLACE YOU CAN FIND CHINESE FOOOD**<br><br>Let me advise you why not to come here:<br>- first walked in, stood there and waited at the entrance for a good 6-7 minutes for someone to acknowledge my existence although 4 staff members made contact with me as well as it not being busy.<br><br>-when my family and I were seated, table next to us had seemingly waited patiently for someone to take their orders. The women and her grandma asked they can please order. The staff members never came around and so they walked out on their table. We were totally shocked.<br><br>-Service was worse than most Chinese restaurants which makes me very tolerable to bad service. But, their servers fit in the category of extreme. They give you attitude, they ignore your requests of their service even when you scream out &#34;hi, excuse me!&#34; while raising your arm. Worst of all was when everyone finished their food with the first two entrees ordered had been forgotten, the lady denied of with such a strong passion that they didn&#39;t forget about the two entrees. Six of us were all finished before the two had even got their food. No apologies, no nothing. <br><br>-then, they asked for the check and they slapped it on the table while saying, &#34;gratuity is included&#34;. No thank you, no smile, not even a slight glance before walking away. We reread the menu to double check if they ever mentioned a gratuity policy with a certain number of people. Nope! None.<br><br>-MOST IMPORTANTLY...THEIR FOOD. The Sui kaow wonton egg noodle soup was mediocre. It had only 1 choy with 5 pieces and was very small. Looked like something you can make at home. Not worth it. Seafood pan friend noodles had too much gravy which made the noodles very soggy. The egg drop beef over rice was horrible. It literally looked like a plate of rice, 7-10 small chunks of beef with scrambled egg then clear gravy poured right on top with it the whole dish being very bland. Our XO chow fun was super bland but overly covered in chilli flakes. Worst of all was finding a dried clump of vermicelli that had chili on it randomly on one of our entrees that had no no vermicelli. It means they&#39;re dirty because it was right on top when they placed the entree down.<br><br>This is not the place to go if you want a good meal and experience with very valuable family time. They wasted our time.	0
This place broke the cardinal rule and did not provide chips and house salsa at the table. The Pastor was passable but the asada was eh... Oh and prices were not in line with the portions or quality.	0
Sul Lung Tang is my second favorite Korean meal after New Year's after SaeBae. There are a variety of great Sul Lung Tang restaurants in KTown, but personally this place is in contention for the best. Although the broth may be a little on the clear side, it's had all the fat strained so that it isn't as heavy a meal. I can down a whole bowl and not feel guilty and fat for pigging out. They also have great kimchi and kakdugi. The whole kimchi juice is in the teapot is also genius. There's only one other place that competes in my book... Which one do you like better?	1
My friend recommended Junior&#39;s cheesecake since it&#39;s featured on food network. I am not a big fan of cheesecake, but I decided to sacrifice myself for the &#34;greater&#34; taste. I am not gonna whine about paying $6.50 for a slice of strawberry cheesecake since I spent $9.50 at Roxy Delicatessen the next day, but I just can&#39;t appreciate the cheesecake here. It tasted more like cream cake than cheesecake. And one thing really bothered me was that the strawberries weren&#39;t hulled.	0
Worst experience and pretty sure I have food poisoning.My boyfriend and I went tonight around 6pm. After we had mentioned to the hostess if she could check on our 2 burgers because we had been waiting almost 40 minutes, she came back and said the food will be out soon.I'm pretty sure the cooks just put whatever was done on a plate and brought it out My boyfriend kept saying his burger was weird and that it was melting in his mouth and was super light and soft. I thought that was a good thing but when I saw it and tasted it myself (you couldn't tell because it had so much sauce at first) I noticed it was completely raw. Beyond rare and mushy We both will never go back. Absolutely disgusting and now feel sick	0
If this is the pinnacle of the Cuban Sandwich, then maybe it is not for me. None of the ingredients popped for me. Meh, I&#39;ve experienced better was exactly what I thought;	0
We had a great experience at Rock Bottom. Food was quick and good. The calamari could have used a little more salt but everything else. We were seated quickly and had great service. Easy to get reservations!!	1
Good coffee, supposedly-fancy food that never pans out. The service is 25% great and 75% too-cool-for-school. (You know that hipster thing where they either lavishly describe each ingredient or just act like you&#39;re bothering them....)<br><br>I&#39;m never going back.<br><br>Yes, the coffee is terrific, if absurdly expensive. But sometimes they take forever to make your cup. Everyone else gets theirs, and the barista is still mystically waving boiling water through the air for yours.<br><br>The food is great in theory, but in practice, not so much.<br><br>Ordinary meals are given odd names and odder treatments. A &#34;breakfast sandwich&#34; is served on a &#34;biscuit&#34; which is hard and dry. The bacon on said sammich is so thick it can&#39;t be eaten.<br><br>The omelettes are just dry, overcooked egg, with stuff rolled up in them. The filling flavors never meld. They never soften the egg with cream or water: it&#39;s like rubber. Great quality ingredients treated badly. What&#39;s the point of putting hard sundried tomatoes with soft carmelized onions and bits of cheese that never merge with the other ingredients? I end up taking it apart and treating it as egg-paper and some condiments.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me started on the toast, which is never dark, always soft (no matter how &#39;whole-grained&#39; it is), and overly greased--when you don&#39;t even ask for it to be.<br><br>The last straw for me was a &#39;German pancake&#39; which took 30 minutes to cook: no warning, I just sat there for 25 minutes until I inquired, everyone else in the joint who ordered after me already having been served, only to be told &#34;oh that takes half an hour.&#34; &#34;Could you not have mentioned that?&#34; I inquired pointlessly.<br><br>Then said pancake was unsalted, flour-y and wet. Unsuitable for eating. Again, good ingredients poorly cooked. Poor communication.<br><br>The pastries are awesome, even if some of them are hard and dry. <br><br>But if you want to spend $10-12 on a dry pastry and a great cup of (slowly-made coffee), this is the place for you.<br><br>But it&#39;s not for me.	0
The pork shoulder sandwiches here are the main attraction, and they are AMAZING served with the garlic aioli sauce, corn on the cob, and a soda.	1
Service is incredibly rude. She told me to &#34;be patient&#34; when I asked for water after sitting for 10+ min. Sandwiches are delicious. But won&#39;t be going back due to terrible service.	0
You can really work up a thirst in and around Red Hook...<br><br>That&#39;s because it&#39;s so goddamn far from everything, and when the bus doesn&#39;t show up you probably end up saying &#34;Screw it!&#34; and just walking it down Van Brunt.<br><br>Then, just as the shimmering heat mirages start to gang up on you, you spot the Brooklyn Ice House.<br><br>Happily, you see that they have two pulled pork sandwiches for $5.00 (not the greatest BBQ I&#39;ve ever had, but consider them decent bar food and you&#39;ll be happy). <br><br>The draft selections are good, diverse, and change regularly...Although prices are what you&#39;d pay lots of places: ~$6/pint.<br><br>But there&#39;s a diverse selection of bottled beers (Sixpoint and lots of others) really cheap, like $3/bottle.<br><br>Has an appealing DIY patio/backyard space. Lots of beat-up old metal chairs in Crayon primary colors, gravel floor, big umbrellas, and ramshackle tables -- homemade in the best sense.	1
let Fremont and Belltown keep all of the places like this ... unfortunately Ballard seems to be seeing more not less of this type of place what with Linda opening a !?!swanky burger joint!?! down on Ballard Ave. There are better happy hours better fish tacos and better tortilla soup within spitting distance of this crowdstuffed loud singles place. Give me a beer at Hatie's Hat and let's call it a night!	0
LBW makes it so I don&#39;t have to leave the neighborhood for a good cocktail. El Chupacabra and the Green Eyes were delicious. Burger was really great as well. Everyone has heard of this place by now and it was packed at 7pm on a Friday. Baos were meh. We tried the steak and pork belly and I wouldn&#39;t order either of those again. Would definitely order the burger though. Overall, good service, great drinks and a nice addition to the neighborhood.	1
oh. my. god. get over chipotle already. it sucks, it&#39;s expensive and i had to sit across from some dumb kid with gigantic plugs, a straight edge tattoo that took up the length of her entire SHIN, and BRACES. YOU ARE 12 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING. it sounds irrelevant but that&#39;s the type of self-important, desperate alt-kid wannabes that suck chipotle&#39;s wang so hard. when you&#39;re old enough to get a job, save up for laser tattoo removal because i&#39;m sure you will cave in and get hammered when you realize what a dumb ass thing you have done to your body. in the meantime, i will be getting my mexican food from moe&#39;s, roberto&#39;s and qdoba. actually, pretty much anywhere but dumb ass chipotle.	0
D.I.R.T.Y....went here for breakfast because it is near our hotel and had 4.5 stars. When we walked in no one greeted us and no one was at the counter. We took a quick look at the menu, which was very old, and ordered two cafe au lait. Every single table inside was dirty, my chair had a whole in it, and after looking around we took our coffees to go. I couldn&#39;t find a sanitation grade anywhere, but I&#39;m sure it was low. I don&#39;t know how this place has such good reviews.	0
When we dined at Cleo, they had been open a mere five days. I expected a shaky kitchen, spotty service and a healthy dose of chaos. What I experienced was some of the most flavorful Middle-Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine I&#39;d ever tasted-- brought to our table by a server who&#39;s knowledge of the menu was as encyclopedic as she was adorable-- all in a vibrant, exciting atmosphere. Some favorites were the wagyu and pork belly kababs, grilled octopus, mushrooms, brussels sprouts and the duck bastilla-- but nearly everything we had (12 small plates in all) was incredibly flavorful and well-prepared. And don&#39;t let me forget the cocktails. We ordered six or seven different drinks throughout our meal-- all superb-- and each one had some little unexpected twist to the flavor profile that paired perfectly with the exotic spices in the food. We&#39;ll be back!	1
This place is so LA I half expected the characters from 90210 to be sitting by the pool. The two stars are for the view, the taste of the drinks, and their willingness to relocate us from an inside table in a corner to one by the pool. For anyone that&#39;s wondering I paid $17 for a small serving of mediocre pasta and we were there during sunset hour so I wanna say I paid about $7 each for some margaritas. The patrons ranged from casually dressed to guys puffin on cigars in pinstriped suits lounging on the couches. We had no reservations but were seated right away anyway(the hostess wasn&#39;t too happy about us not having reservations despite the place being almost empty at 6pm). The waitresses all look like models, and that&#39;s standard in most nice places in LA. These waitresses probably are the kind that say &#34;I&#39;m an actress and work part time as a waitress&#34; instead of the other way around. So LA. They also act as if they&#39;ve made it big somehow. If you like pretentiousness on the part of the wait staff come here. Also they take forever to bring the food/drinks and are extremely rude. We encountered 2 waitresses who acted this way. Maybe I looked poor so they didn&#39;t want to waste their time. *shrugs* I am definitely not complaining about the price of this place because it is a nice experience with a great view in the best city in the world (I may be a little biased) but the service is terrible and it makes me not want to go back.	0
Eh food. Coffee shop grilled cheese cold and store bought fake cheese.Poor boy rich girl was unappetizing. Our waiter Ian B. with the "statche" was pretty mediocre and kinda ignored us. Looked like he needed to learn to smile. Also I later received a very harassing yelp message about this post...No mirror in the bathroom?!	0
This is a must have restaurant for your Madison bucket list. Easily one of my favorite places, and not just because my friend used to work here.	1
We had great service our waitress was awesome! Granted we went during lunch on a Tuesday but our service was awesome. Beer was great exactly as described and the food was wonderful and sourced locally. One of the best restaurants we have been in the touristy areas of Seattle.	1
The perch rooftop outside dining is one of the best environments in downtown LA. <br><br>The service is utterly professional, warm and friendly. Our server, Elizabeth, was super helpful to recommend dishes and drink pairings.<br><br>To start, I&#39;d recommend the pork belly and tuna. Perfect portions. We had the &#34;little bunny fru&#34; entree, the risotto, along with amazing side of brussels. <br><br> We came on a Friday night and the live band was a great complement to the night.<br><br>I&#39;ll be back.	1
Great food, music, and atmosphere. A hidden gem in vegas away from the strip. I will definitely return	1
Cauliflower Truffle Soup. No trip to Toulouse is complete without this divine soup! The brasserie has friendly, quick service and outstanding food. The steak with the crawfish tasso sauce was incredible, accompanied with a great wine selection. Both my entree and wine choice were recommendations from the waiter, who listened to my preferences and made suggestions accordingly. No visit to Seattle is complete without stopping here for dinner.	0
Ordered a slice and paid for it. One of the owners placed it in the oven. A minute later he looked at me like he had never seen me before. Then he took a phone call. I waited 5 mins and tried to get his attention as my slice burned. Another guy finally asked if I needed help. He took out the burned slice and tried to pass it off as &#34;crispy.&#34; I asked for a new one that had just come out of the oven. The owner was still on the phone and didn&#39;t bother to ask what was going on. The dough was nearly raw in the middle. I couldn&#39;t finish it. Just got up and left. When I left the owner was still on the phone. Are these guys kidding? Shame because if they just cooked it properly it would be very good. Another issue is it doesn&#39;t seem like anyone speaks English.	0
Had a late lunch here last week. Very charming decor, with plenty of small tables, abundant plant decorations, and comfy seating.<br><br>I had the lunch set, which includes 2 rice balls, your choice of miso soup, pickled vegetables, and a small side. I had the hawaiian and eel rice balls, preferring the hawaiian (Spam never tasted so good!). The miso soup with mushrooms was delicate and far more nuanced than the normal miso at the ubiquitous sushi restaurants. The pickles could have been a little more strongly flavored/salted, but had a nice crunch to them.<br><br>All in all, for $10, hard to beat a place like this for lunch!	1
Go here! Order the wine blessed by the local Rabbi, it&#39;s good for your soul and also a Mitzvah... Cheers	1
Decently good, but nothing sensational. These are the sentiments I had after a group of 9 friends and myself went. For being in a large group, the services was timely. However, I wasn't necessarily crazy about the sourdough bread and tomato cream cheese spread: I was just starved! They were sort of awkward flavors to pair together.	0
Went for Brunch. Ordered the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise and the scrambled egg enchiladas with chorizo, red chile sauce and goat cheese.<br><br>The enchiladas were so tiny they looked like taquitos. There were two extremely small tortillas filled with barely any eggs on a plate with some sauce. For $16, I expected A LOT more. <br><br>The poached egg/hash concoction was inedible. The spice totally overpowered the dish. I could not taste any flavors of sweet potatoes, chicken or egg. <br><br>This ended up being a super disappointing experience.	0
Our Anniversary Dinner. Wonderful experience even if the weatherman was wrong. Service attentive &amp; friendly. Appetizer was a cheese plate w/some well-selected cheeses &amp; garnishes &amp; a beautiful presentation. Hubby had crab cakes which he said were excellent. I had a chicken medallions dish w/risotto &amp; spinach. Spinach was very tasty, risotto was good with a nice-sized serving &amp; chicken medallions had a very flavorful, slightly teasing sauce making you want more. Hubby had a unique creme brulee for dessert/chocolate w/hazelnuts &amp; macadamia nuts. He does not normally choose creme brulee, but he loved this creme brulee. I had a very generous, well-presented raspberry sorbet. Ian, the Mgr visited us &amp; was very hospitable. A very enjoyable day.	0
Honestly one star for the music and my wife's Arnold Palmer . Started with the quinoa salad. Bland does not describe it accurately. It was romaine with a scoop of quinoa and some cranberries and carrots. The portion was huge but bland. We tried to rescue it with salt and pepper. No dice. Next we had the short rib grilled cheese and a turkey burger. Every burger person knows the secret to a good burger is the bun. These tasted like Ralph's 50 percent off aisle buns. Everything else on turkey burger was bland. Wife's short rib sandwich looked gross and tasted so bland tapito could not salvage it. Service was good but the chefs need to learn to properly season their food. Won't be back.	0
This place is amazing. It&#39;s in a nice quiet area between Ave A and 1st Ave on 10th street and this little gem is perfect for anyone. We use it to study because it has perfect drinks, snacks and wi-fi (just ask for the password). It is very affordable and the best drink is easily the chai. No matter who it is working the cafe, they always &#34;accidentally&#34; make a little bit too much and so they fill up your mug or to-go cup and give you a little something something to sip on the side while you wait for your food or if you just wanna quick hit of the delicious drink. Definitely recommend this place.	1
Always great people, outstanding food and great service.  If you haven't been the Bootlegger you are missing a great part of Vegas history and dining/entertainment.	1
It was a good and nice place to visit again. And the service is good too. It won't take too long to wait for the food when you get in if you use opentable to make a reservation. It just took me 5 mins online to book the seat. Therefore, it is extremely convenience for me to go there and get in without waiting.	1
Went there last week and had fish and chips. Got sick for 3 days . !!!	0
try the shwarma plate it's delicious!	1
We had a terrible experience at the cafe...staff was non-existent and food was not what it should have been. Ingredients were old, seafood was fishy, meat was overcooked. Very upsetting, nobody minds spending on meals as long as it is a good product.	0
You&#39;ll pay extra for the history and hours of the place, but nonetheless, as a cornerstone of the Los Angeles culinary scene, everyone needs at least one 3am breakfast order in their life&#39;s CV.	1
Oh, there is a God. <br><br>Little Choc Apothecary just opened and claims to be NYC&#39;s &#34;first all-vegan creperie.&#34; I literally fell over with excitement. No cheese, no gluten, nothing to worry about. I can get literally anything on the menu without fumbling over explanations for why I need to leave out butter, or whipped cream, or milk, or... you get the idea. <br><br>I wanted to try literally everything on the menu. Everything. I settled with Room for Mushroom, but come on, I have to go back and try &#34;Newtella&#34; (the homemade dairy-free nutella). and all the desserts, and juices to make me feel like I can undo all the indulgences. Who wants to go on a date with me EVERY DAY until I finish eating my way through their menu? Even their hot chocolate is vegan!<br><br>Finally, I can truly use the title of my favorite Yelp list here. Legen-non-dairy! Fine, fine, I&#39;ll admit it. I guess there is *some* use to Williamsburg being trendy-hipster-overrun. <br><br>PS- their Kickstarter campaign video is adorable!	1
I've been to La Brea Bakery maybe 6 or 7 times since they opened. I'm happy to say that with one exception, they have really started to hit their stride. The service was friendly and attentive. Yay. The food well realized. The only thing that is really subpar still is their coffee--which I know. I actually warned my coffee loving friend from Seattle when we were deciding between La Brea and Sycamore Kitchen. The room is lovely-airy and light. The baked goods are excellent. One thing that is odd to me is that there are beautiful prepared salads and pastries that you see when you walk in, but not mentioned on the menu anywhere. If you ask, you can get them, but why not put them on the menu? Really that food looks more interesting than what is on the menu. Anyway, very happy to see the improvements. Will keep coming back. The turkey sandwich is a favorite.	1
The food is ok. Lunch is pretty good. But they should hire better people at the cash register. People that know customer service and don&#39;t have a bitchy know it all attitude.	0
Enjoyed a lovely dinner in this vibrant busy restaurant. The food was great service excellent & just a slightly-too-long delay between courses but for dinner this just allowed us to enjoy the ambience.	1
Only reason it gets two stars is because the sausage on the pizza was yummy...where to begin...the only thing the server and assistant cared about was clearing the table, the hostess walked by our table a total of 12 times and we tried to get her attention about 12 times for silverware and she kept walking, when we finally got someone's attention it was an inconvenience for us to get silverware, and our waitress to get a second drink, am sure this won't get posted so sending their nice Holiday card back to them the old fashioned way by snail mail, and it gives me hope that service is by gadgets at least it will be more responsive	0
Truly, I do not understand those 5* reviews. <br>We have tried the cabbage, the squids, and the blade steak. ALL 3 dishes had too much salt. Why? Haven&#39;t you guys heard that this is not healthy? This was not just my opinion, my girlfriend said the same thing. The blade steak , that ppl dying for here at Yelp was chewy, salty and therefore tasteless. This was my first time there and the last one.	0
Syrups desserts or a filling sandwichSorry syrups but a full stomach will satisfy anyoneGetting off work at 3AM in downtown is like weird and scaryI had decided to skip desert for my lunch which is at midnightand decided to get a feel for home away from home from LA CafeLocated on spring street in DTLA the atmosphere walking was like a well lit modern for people on the goI walked in and it was quite lively at 3AM in the morningOrdered a Grilled Lobster sandwich which came with fresh potato chips on the side5 Min Later My sandwich is brought out to meBiting in to the ooey gooey goodness i was stunned by how remarkable the sandwich tasted as it was crispy and softMy only complaint was the saltiness in the sandwich which was a tad higher than i expected.overall Customer service was awesome, whether it be to keep the homeless from stealing my bag and food (true story) or helping me find the first bus that took me back home at 4AMP.S. the parklet next to the cafe (mini-park) has exercise equipment as well as a table and gamesjoin in and relax while you can	1
Lovely place for a lovely meal. <br><br>YUMS<br>: Fried oyster sandwich - meaty, succulent, a thing of perfection. <br>: Halibut carpaccio - WOW, absolutely ridiculous. Crisp, cold, paper-thin slices of halibut on toasted flat bread. One for the senses. <br>: Rice balls - fried, cheesy, need I say more?<br><br>UMS<br>: Fried quail &amp; polenta waffles - trying to mimic a Roscoe&#39;s Chicken &#39;n Waffles thing, but falling way short of the same satisfaction. I liked the tenderness and gaminess of the quail, but the fried battered skin was a bit much for such a delicate bird. Would not get it again.	1
Gotta tell you I was super skeptical when making a res at Perch. It was for my husband's birthday, he's super picky and pretty jaded and I was scared it was going to just be a scene with a great view. Well, I couldn't have been more off. The view WAS ridiculous and our table by the fireplace couldn't have been more divine. Felt like I was in Paris with the great drink list, or at the very least NYC. The food was INSANE. Having studied French cooking for two summers in France, again, was ready to complain. Nope. Cheese plate with perfect amount I quince paste. Short ribs with to-die-for, not shy horseradish, veggie terrine and RIDONCULOUS white chocolate bread pudding, not a competitor in town. Really great value and even a good spot for me to make a pit stop for the next date night. J'adore!	1
Soju Bloody Mary is SO good!	1
Deep fried pig everything. Cannot taste anything, but crunchy and salty. Disappointed. Will not go again.	0
Been going here for about thirty years. It&#39;s much pricier than most burger joints. So, let your price worries go when judging. You&#39;ve been warned. The fries are either one of the best in L.A. or just okay, depending on what I have no idea. The steakburger is one of L.A.&#39;s classics. I love the Tillamook cheddar cheese. I love the relish. It has too much lettuce though. I asked for less once, but was given an indignant look by one of the servers who I think was there the first time I ate there. As said, I only did that once. And I&#39;m not at all bashful. I think I just felt like I perpetrated a crime, without feeling guilty about it.<br><br>I had a sandwich once instead of a burger, cos they looked so good when i saw them. It was really good. I can&#39;t remember which one it was. I love getting a Dr. Pepper there and drinking it in the paper cone they give you, full of ice. I love the glass bottles of Heinz ketchup. <br><br>They&#39;re named for pie. The apple pie is pretty good, but there is a huge dome of air because they don&#39;t use pie birds. Not sure what to think about that. The Dreyer&#39;s ice cream that they have to get with the pie is the best vanilla ice cream I&#39;ve ever had. Where the hell do they get it? It&#39;s like triple super duper french vanilla. <br><br>Yes, I will go to the Apple Pan periodically for as long as I live in or visit L.A. I guess I am more than a fan. This is one of my childhood haunts.	1
Overall, Excellent. <br>Friendly staff, outstanding food. Priced fairly for the portions, taste, and atmosphere. <br>We ordered Asian style calamari, truffle Mac n cheese, glazed pork chop, skirt steak, and crispy skinned salmon. All were perfect. <br>Dessert was chocolate fondue with fruit. <br>We will definitely return.	1
I went for their lunch special, but they ran out of soup. They also ran out of eggrolls. They also ran out of curry. It took forty-five minutes for them to make new curry. <br><br>The extra star is for the service. Our waitress was very nice and apologetic about things which she couldn&#39;t control. <br><br>After I ate, I also ran out. I&#39;m not running back in either.	0
View of the water from the rooftop in fells point - lovely for an outdoor dining experience. The quality of the food is similar to their sister restaurant the Black Olive but considerably cheaper!	0
This place is a good old fashioned diner. You can actually feel the legitness of the old-fashionedness here. It wasn't some diner where they try to make it all clean and organized and brand-new, you can tell this place has been around for a while.The food was good, it was kind of greasy but that's the way I like my food. The amount of hashbrowns they give you is insane. You can literally have a whole meal just by eating the hashbrowns. The sourdough toast /w jam is good, the sausage is good (although they could be bigger), the eggs (i got them scrambled) was good, the pancakes were pretty soft and good. I don't think they serve waffles though.I think they charge a tiiiny bit too much for certain food, but that's fine. Pretty good place, I'm not surprised that it stayed in business this long.	1
I have been coming here for about 28 years. Seems like the place never changes. Feels like you step back in time. The food is very good, its an experience every time you are there. It's nothing fancy, but you know you are in Los Angeles, by all the different types of people that walk through the door. I feel like I enjoy my meal, and get some free entertainment also by people watching. Open 24 hours, so a great place to go late at night. Smoked Turkey Reuben, and Mishmosh Matzah ball soup is my favorite.	1
I love Little Dom's. What I don't love are pushy waitresses. Read your client. If they are not in a hurry, quit asking what they want. The artichoke was not as good as it usually is, but the crab fritters and beet salad were very good. The brussel sprouts needed more bacon, but the meatloaf was delicious. Gnochi was too saucy without enough gnochi. The squash fritters were very good. I also reccomend the Genuine Risk, a lovely easy going red.	1
MAKE A RESERVATION - thank me later. <br><br>I&#39;m so glad that I made a reservation for brunch with my girlfriends. When we got there, there were plenty of people waiting for a table or even sitting in the sun. Because we had a reservation, we got seated in a cute little booth, in the shade, with the best view ever. <br><br>Brunch food was priced very affordably, considering it&#39;s a fancier place to dine. If you check in on yelp, you get a free order of fries. Most of us ordered the lasagna pancakes. Great portion for just over $10. We got a carafe mimosa which was $18 and came out to about 6 mimosa glasses. Then we got a round of patron shots. You definitely get your money&#39;s worth because the shots are huge!<br><br>Service: our server Andrew was super cool. Super helpful with recommendation on food and checking up on us whenever he thought we were done with our meal. Also, other workers checked up on us to see if we needed more water or wanted another carafe. My water cup was never less than half full before it was refilled again. <br><br>Overall: great place for brunch. I was obviously expecting dishes to be over $30 for a small portion of food but everything was basically under $15 and the view was amazing. The best part, free parking across the street!! The guy said we didn&#39;t have to pay so we got lucky :) definitely coming back!	1
After MUCH debate as to where to go for brunch this morning, we finally decided on Tilikum, mostly based on high Yelp reviews, appealing pictures, and what appeared to be good windows for people watching. We had considered another option, Grub, purely for a sandwich described in the Brunch edition of Seattle Met. There was jam involved, it was hard to pass up. In the end, Tilikum won out- no regrets here! We got in around 1:30, (brunch goes until 2:00 on Sunday), and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. About the time it took to walk to the space needle and back. We sat at the bar, started off with Bloody Marys. House made Mary mix was on point, served with pickled onion, green bean and lemon slice. Good amount of heat too which is always nice. We found out the special was The Monte Christo, which consists of a thinly sliced ham and gruyere cheese sandwich with ricotta and jam, entirely fried. You would think it would be more greasy, but it was surprisingly crisp the entire way through. And I'm a stickler about crispiness. It was SOO good. Out of the 3 options for Dutch babies, we went with the sweet ones with has pears sprinkled in, topped with toasted almonds. Also delicious with the side of maple syrup. Oh, also the espresso was a perfect post brunch drink as well! The bartender was fantastic too- all the staff really. Everything was great, definitely coming back. The omelets looked really good too, would like to try one of those sometime. Wondering if they have a happy hour though..	1
I love coming to the Shrimp Lover or just ordering in for a great night of seafood and a movie. Great family place and they have beer/wine for dine in. The prices can be a tad bit high but it&#39;s definitely worth it.	1
I don&#39;t know what it is about little gems in the middle of the most unexpected areas but they always have my heart. The name really says it all. A tiny shopping center, a busy street, parking on the roof, graffiti on the walls, people sitting on their front porches across the street watching you like you&#39;ve invaded their space. But just like that, even with all the surroundings, in this little hidden corner, I walk in and feel like I am back in Barcelona. <br><br>The cook came out, explained the specials, shared some stories and magically worked the tables and the kitchen. It truly feels like you are at some distant Tio&#39;s house in Spain. Mismatched chairs, pantries stocked with goodies, hanging pots and pans, the cook talking to you from the kitchen. This is no ordinary restaurant. This was home with a menu.<br><br>We had more tapas than I can remember. My favorite were the spinach croquetas and the paella. My only disappointment was the cheese platter. I expected more, but just not the type of thing you go there for in my opinion. Dessert was homemade chocolate truffles and were delicious. <br><br>What makes this place stand out from other Spanish restaurants I&#39;ve been to is the ability to not let anyone feel like they are just another customer being waited on. When you&#39;re here, you&#39;re family and you feel that from the very moment you walk in.	1
East Williamsburg has a new gem! This might not even sound possible, but this &#34;farm to fork eatery&#34; is both decadent AND wholesome. Casual and welcoming, with a warm, well-trained staff, AWOL features small plates that are plenty large enough to be shared and delicious enough that you&#39;ll want to order them all. Mains include pizzas and the best array of sliders anywhere (I suggest the Quinoa one.) It is VERY veg friendly but don&#39;t miss the short rib slider if you swing that way. Beer and wine cocktails are inventive...and you won&#39;t need a stiff one when the bill comes. I suspect AWOL will be tough to get into soon--so go go go while they are still making a name for themselves!	1
My husband and I were in the neighborhood, hungry for pizza, and wanted to try somewhere we hadn&#39;t been before. Emily pops up on Yelp and we head right over. It was still a bit early in the evening, so getting a table was no problem. <br><br>While the menu is a bit small, there are still more than enough choices for everyone. We settled on sharing The Wrestler (sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, black olives, mushrooms) and waiting patiently as we watched the nifty pizza oven do its work.<br><br>Our pizza arrived even quicker than we expected and, oh yeah, it was super-delicious! I would call it a medium-sized pizza, so I ate half and he ate half. We felt happily full at the end of our meal and glad that we chose to come. <br><br>We&#39;d definitely come back here again and I highly recommend it for a date night - intimate and delicious :)	1
Best burger in Madison:	1
Color me underwhelmed. I&#39;ve been wanting to go to Bogota for awhile, and finally made it here when a friend came to visit from out of town. So maybe it was my high expectations, but I just didn&#39;t think the food was that great.<br><br>The food took about half an hour to get there -- but to make it all right, they gave us some plantain chips which turned out to be better than anything we actually ordered. I had the vegetarian tacos with tostones and kale. The tacos were fine -- tasty tortilla, your average sauteed vegetables, none of the queso-fresco-and-sour-creamy goodness you get from a taco joint in Sunset Park or something -- and the kale was quite good, but the tostones were so tough and dry as to be almost inedible, which is a shame because I usually love them.<br><br>Maybe it was because it was a Friday night, and the place was packed? Maybe our food was waiting in the kitchen for half an hour? Maybe not ordering drinks was our mistake? In any event, next time I&#39;ll go across the street to Los Pollitos. It may not be nearly as trendy, but there&#39;s no wait, the food is fresh, and it costs about half as much.	0
The food is whatever but the service is really bad. Me and my girlfriend came here and we were not really sure what to do with the wrapped oysters. At the time, the restaurant was not that busy and after struggling with it a few minutes with the waitress watching us , we finally had to ask the waitress to come over. When she came over, she acted like we were bothering her and was really unhappy. We drove a hour to eat here and while we were semi satisfied with the food the service is why turned us off a lot.	0
Pyramid is a great restaurant on non game day and on a game day they're crowded and noisy with the folks trying to eat and drink before going to the game. The foods good the beer is great the service is great if you don't show up on a game day. I've been there on a game day and I don't know how they keep up with the crowd but somehow they manage.	1
I was recommended to this place for some cheap food by my friend. I think he comes here when he&#39;s drunk/hungover. I was too sober for this. Our entire table got the steak eggs for $5.99 at around 12am when we had just arrived in Vegas. My dining experience was pretty much ruined by weirdos and loud skanky girls.	0
In downtown, i just have been few places, this is one of them, pretty nice service and good taste though.	1
Legit, honest, and very comfortable.<br><br>The place has a diner feel.<br><br>Parking lot is very small so if you can&#39;t find any space don&#39;t worry just park on the streets.<br><br>And basically how you seat yourself is hover around a person so scatter your group LOL.<br><br>Waiters there are genuinely nice. I think it was cash only since they used old style cash registers.	1
The steak burger was pretty good. Never got the chance to eat here because it&#39;s always packed so I always take my order for to go which they make really fast. They&#39;re burgers are really good but not the best for me.	1
What a weird drop off from first visit to second. First time I went, the octopus taco was so amazing I got another right away. This time, it was chewy and weird. Some noticeable quality drops in other dishes as well. C'mon petty cash!! Don't get lazy!!!!!I wish it didn't say "Meh. I've experienced better" when you click two stars. I would never say "Meh." I can't get behind that.	0
We've dined at Bistro Blanc in Glenelg many times and have always enjoyed our meals, but on our latest visit, the chef truly outdid himself.  We began with the crispy Brussels sprouts in a maple and lime glaze and the soup du jour, a split pea with pork belly and apple salad. The soup was inventive and complex, with anise, cardamom, Vietnamese cinnamon and black and white pepper adding  a spicy punch to the broth. A small micro-salad served atop croutons sat in the middle of the bowl. This was totally unexpected and a true gastronomic treat. Our entrees included the lamb burger and the absolute star of the evening, the grouper. The burger was cooked perfectly and served with crisp, fresh cut fries. The grouper was perhaps the best seafood dish I have ever had in a restaurant--it was cooked perfectly with flesh that had an almost creamy texture.  It was served atop a heavenly mix of roasted edamame &amp; hazelnut chutney, wild hedgehog mushrooms, pickled pearl onions, and micro arugula.  A burnt miso 'butterscotch' emulsion also adorned the plate .  I'm usually not at a loss for words when describing my dining experiences here on OpenTable, but this dish left me speechless and bested meals we have had at Volt, Alchemy, Highland Inn and Tersiguel's.  Bartender/waiter Andy provided wonderful service and solid menu recommendations, as usual.  A fantastic job all around, Bistro Blanc.  Thank you!	0
Very slow service if you get this skinny white chick that looks like Jessica Biel.	0
A small Korean restaurant specializing in abalone porridge. It's not really a cafe. Cafe--you think coffee and pastries, but this place is definitely NOT a cafe. It's your comfort Korean food restaurant. I got the abalone porridge, which was very tasty. I mixed it with the raw egg they put on top of it. The amount was filling. I haven't tried anything else, but I am assuming that you should come here mostly if you just are craving for good abalone porridge. The selection isn't as good as Bon Juk for juks. IF you want PAHT JUK or Pumpkin JUK, go to Bon Juk or somewhere else. The venue is VERY VERY small. Very crowded but when I went there weren't much people, although it got packed the moment my friends and I left.Recommended!	1
Awesome Food! The Best!	1
I liked the view. The food was average, nothing to rave about. I&#39;ve had A LOT better, I&#39;ve had a LOT worse. I think I will stick with the drinks here, since really, it&#39;s all about the view. The tables were cramped but the outdoor dining area is very limited so that was to be expected. <br><br>The service was great. We were seated right away and the waitress was helpful and attentive. <br><br>Honest opinion, skip dinner and go for drinks and sociable atmosphere.	1
Ingredients always fresh, very yummy. Be patient with the service is not the greatest. I always order to go or delivery,	1
Came for brunch (really, it was nearly 2 PM), and were it not for their $15 bottomless mimosas, this place would be dismal. I had the short rib hash... seriously, not a dash of salt was used in that dish. It needed hot sauce, flavor, anything! I tried taking my left overs home, but anyone who's ever tried to salvage breakfast foods know they are inedible. Thankful the mimosas were good. I also had a bite of the eggs Benedict. I guess pretty standard as far as eggs Benedict is concerned. Did I mention the mimosas? With all the eateries in the area I'd venture elsewhere next time, but thank God for those mimosas.	0
While in Vegas most dine on the strip.  This restaurant has been around for a long time.  It may be a short drive from the strip but it is worth every mile you drive.  Food is fantastic and its an old world place to eat.  A Great Experience.  I will go back again next year.	1
My boyfriend and I have been here a few times now, and we always leave quite satisfied. The fish quality is great, and they have great dinner specials. I mean, 3 specialty rolls for $25.00 is a phenomenal deal! The service is always pleasant, and the restaurant ambiance is relaxing. If you are looking for good sushi at great prices, I recommend Ohjah.	1
This place is adorable. The view, the overall atmosphere, the French music, and the truffle mac n cheese! Happy girl, I was.Came for happy hour on a Friday and was seated right away. I was told the line to get in is usually crazy. Got lucky, I guess.I ordered a raspberry flavored glass of champagne. Nothing special. The bf ordered a Jacques Collins, which was mostly ice, but delish! The fresh lemon in it was refreshing.Lots of variety on the happy hour menu, but we decided to go with beef sliders and the truffle mac n cheese. The sliders were bland and came out cold. Reminded me of the frozen kind you get at the grocery store. MEH! The truffle mac n cheese was a different story. So, so tasty!Definitely coming back.. mostly because the place is so cute and the view really can't be beat.	1
Warning: this place is SMALL!!Otherwise I really did love everything about The Far Bar! It was a cute place for a friend and I to sit down, grab a drink and just catch up. We stopped in on a Wednesday night so the place was relatively deserted and a great place to just chill and talk.We ordered two gin and tonics (although the drink menu looked promising) and wasabi fries - the total bill was $22. If you have a small party, definitely check it out!	1
This is an all you can eat steakhouse. They keep coming until you say stop.	0
Definitely the best tacos I have ever had!! Very friendly staff & cool space.	1
I&#39;ve been here several times, and have tried something different each time. Here&#39;s what I liked and didn&#39;t like:<br><br>Really Liked:<br>- Polish Sausage: crisp, meaty, tasty, and filling<br>- Giardiniera: good flavor and a very nice kick<br>- Gyro: the meat is juicy, and the fresh made tzatziki is excellent<br><br>Liked:<br>- Hot dogs: pretty good, but I&#39;ve had better Chicago dogs; nothing that especially stands out<br><br>On the Fence:<br>- Italian beef: maybe it&#39;s just the one I had, but it was oddly bland<br>- Fries: a little too hard, a little too salty<br><br>Didn&#39;t Like:<br>- Pizza puff: kind of a greasy mess<br><br>Overall, though, the food there I like outweighs the food I&#39;m neutral towards or don&#39;t like. The folks there are also very friendly and they always have ESPN on at least one screen, which is a plus for me. I definitely recommend WCBND, especially their polish sausage and gyro.	1
I hate to have to put this place on blast because I liked it so much, but according to my friend it&#39;s already been on the Hills, so whatever. <br><br>Was taken here for a Sunday brunch double date by my best friend Mariam before the boyfriend and I had to fly back to the Bay. <br><br>Loved, Loved, LOVED it!!! It was so cute!! The ambiance and atmosphere was great!! The food was super yummy, great breakfast as well as lunch dishes. I highly recommend the Falafel Wrap. I was a bit hesitant when my boyfriend wanted to order it, cus I feel like Middle Eastern food needs to come from a Middle Eastern restaurant in order to be good. However, Toast&#39;s rendition of it was pretty spot on to authentic (lavash wrap and all. Pita would&#39;ve been better, but i love me some lavash!).<br><br>Mariam ordered the French Toast. Sooooo good!! I typically don&#39;t allow myself such rich things, but I did snag a bite and Yum-O!!<br><br>All in all I&#39;m adding Toast to my LA food hit list!! Also, if you ever need to go sunglass browsing, this is the place to do it. Granted it&#39;s LA and everyone where&#39;s shades, but this place had all different types, sizes, and colors. So stop by Toast for brunch before you hit up the mall for new shades :oP	1
Very comfortable burger place with good food but not a place to go if you intend to talk - it isn&#39;t possible unless you do sign language. It is a real turn off	0
A great disappointment to our evening out before Opera in the Park."I'm sorry, but I can't create tables out of thin air. You'll have to go somewhere else - all I can offer you is the manager's phone number.... I'm sure you can find better food elsewhere."On the Monday prior, I made a reservation for four people for a Friday evening. Then, I called back on the day of to increase the reservation to eight people. What I - or, should I say, we - could not believe is that upon arriving at Brickhouse, both servers said they had no record of our reservation. Two calls in, two confirmations of our reservation, then... nothing.On top of this, the second server - a colorfully attired woman with a sharp demeanor - was quite rude to us. There was zero empathy for the restaurant's mistake, and little concern for us ever returning to actually try the food. See quote above.I scrambled to find another place to eat for eight on a warm Friday evening, and made the coordinating calls to get everyone there. After a bit of a wait, we managed to get a table at nearby 21st Amendment and arrived in time for the start of the opera at AT&T Park.Shame on you, Brickhouse Cafe.p.s. I am pleased to see that this particular review single-handedly dropped the average from four stars to three-and-a-half. Slainte!	0
Never too crowded, food is good, and the prices are right, but it&#39;s the atmosphere that really seals the deal -- I always feel like I&#39;m getting VIP treatment when I&#39;m in there, and the music adds a little swank to that particular corner on Grand.	1
This is the best Rueben in Los Angeles and thankfully it&#39;s open all night long. I&#39;ve been coming here forever and have never been disappointed.	1
At one time I would have given this place a solid 5 stars. Over time it has definitely lost it&#39;s charms. When I first went in late 2008 I was really impressed- New American locavore fare served by a thorough and conscientious waitstaff. I went back many times until I took my Mother for a nice dinner. She came from very far away and I wanted to treat her to some of Brooklyn&#39;s finest dining and I felt that Applewood fit the bill. The entire experience was disastrous. Our only shining moment came in the beginning as the lovely Matron&#39;D seated us and asked us how our day was. It all went downhill swiftly from there. Our first plates took forever. They got them wrong. The entree my Mother ordered was extremely overcooked (she ordered veal sweetbreads from the specials menu, what she got resembled pork cracklings both in appearance and in taster) My meat was extremely overcooked. The desserts were the size of my fingernail. And to add injury to insult, everyone of my amazing Ommegang Abbey Ales was poured with the most outrageous head, even despite my efforts to grab it away from his bumbling hands. I&#39;ll say this, I haven&#39;t been back in a while, but it got steadily worse and worse each time I dined here. Maybe I&#39;ll give it another shot, because in the beginning as I mentioned this was indeed a 5 star place as many reviewers have given it.	0
The Doughroom , as for the pizza and salad I must say met my tastebuds in a good way to make them very happy ! i loved the sour beer but was a bit pricey served in a small look alike wine glass, due to that pricey small portion a star was taken away.... server Tyson was on Point	1
I want to like Oddfellows -- great space; simple comfort food. I've enjoyed a great latte and pastry. But a full lunch revealed that the secret is to order simple choices with good ingredients. The BLT and poached egg sandwich for example because how could you ruin brioche bread with a few good ingredients. The spinach salad however demonstrated the lack of caring that infects other dishes. Too small for $8 under-dressed and the farro and seemingly one green olive were too uninspiring to lift it beyond a plate of dry leaves. I actually saw the women at another table lift the plate of spinach salad up to stare closely with furrowed brows as if wondering whether this was it. The accompanying bread tasted a little tired (cut too early?) and was not served with butter. The cold corn soup was overly vegetal perhaps better suited to a cup than a full bowl.	0
Pretty boring food.I got the reuben, had their pickles. The reuben was below average quality, and they didn't even cook the dressing into the sauerkraut - critical part of making a reuben. The corned beef in it was pretty flavorless. Their pickles tasted kind of off. Their fries were steak fries at least - probably the best part of the meal.It's cool they're famous and all, but for $14 for a reuben you better blow me away. Not even close.	0
Great sandwiches and baked goods! Reuben's sandwich is especially awesome here! And in the bakery, they have this marzipan cookie that is AMAZING!I have to say though.. I tried their Monte Cristo sandwich, and did not like that at all. It wasn't a real Monte Cristo.Overall, Canter's is a great place to go with family. It's been around for a long time and gained a great reputation with it. Portions are definitely generous and good for sharing. Service is very friendly also!	1
ENVIRONMENT<br>Kaya is in the style of a quick service restaurant similar to Chipotle. The staff are very helpful and ask is it&#39;s your first time and also encourage sampling to determine what you want. A brilliant idea since not everyone is good at building your own Southeast Asian dish. <br><br>FOOD<br>You can choose to build your own rice bowl, salad, wrap or tacos.<br><br>For protein you can choose steak, chicken or an interesting shrimp and pork meatball.<br><br>Then veggies and sauce.<br><br>VIOLA!	1
Bland. What happened to healthy but still flavorful? somewhat pricey for what you get. Not worth it.	0
My friend could not stop talking about this place. So we went and Oh... my... gosh... those were some amazing burgers! Some people may not like the portion size of the burger but I think it's just right to a point where it makes you full and satisfied but not stuffed and sickly. Granted though.. I do believe they're a little pricey. Maybe a few dollars more than what I would like to spend but who knows why they're that expensive? Then again... how savory and flavorful each burger is maybe it is worth it?I ordered the Umami Burger and I loved it. I took a bite of my boyfriend's and friend's burger, the Carnitas Burger and the Port & Stilton burger. Both were superb! I even had a little bit of my friend's fries (I think they were thin fries with cheese but can't tell you for sure) but nonetheless they were very flavorful. Maybe a little too much for my preference... I probably would not have been able to finished the entire order of sides because the flavor was so strong. I also like their old-fashion and unique flavored sodas. I had the non-alcoholic ginger beer (I know, weird) and I loved it... even my boyfriend that hates ginger liked it. As for the service I think it was pretty good. Our waitress took awhile but the place seemed busy. She was attentive and answered all my friend's questions with a great attitude and also checked up on us frequently throughout our meal. Also... we LOVED our flamboyant server. He was so much fun. Pity the staff doesn't wear nametags. When he brought out our friend's fries he said, "Careful the plate's hot... just like me. :::chuckle::" :)One complaint I do have is the table we had. Granted it is Los Feliz so pretty much all restaurants have half of their tables sitting on the sidewalk but mine and my friend's chairs were on the edge of a small slope and could've easily fallen back if we had moved just inches back. We couldn't move the table too far the other direction because my other friend's seat was in direct line of the door and could've been hit if someone were to be too zealous when opening the door. Overall I really love this place. Granted I won't be visiting this place as much as I like since it IS a little pricey and the ABSOLUTE WORST part was trying to find parking. I'm not big on valeting because I'm paying someone to park my car when I can just add a few steps of exercise to my day.	1
Sunny Crisp was AMAZING. Great sushi!	1
Yum yum yum...	0
This place has amazing food and amazing staff. they are really sweet and care about their food and customer service. The restaurant itself is nice and relaxing and the food was better than I expected it to be. One of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas for me, I&#39;ve been looking forever for good Thai food In Vegas and finally found it. Happy I gave this place a try.	1
This place is overrated. Wanted to take my family to have some good pancakes and this place had a lot if good reviews so tried it out. The place decor is like some bodies house with no furniture. I was like wtf? <br><br>Place had a bit if a wait which is usually good sign of it being good. Service was a total fail. Took forever to get my drink order and then coffee came out first then another 5 mins for my daughters drinks. Took forever to get guys attention to order and then took even longer to get food. I&#39;m a very patient person but service was all over the place.<br><br>So many things went wrong. Bacon was burnt and pancakes were dry. This experience was so sad. I had to get up to get more coffee. People around me were waiting a long time too. They really need to work their operation. I hope they fix it but either way I won&#39;t be back.	0
The food was delicious. I am a huge fan of risotto, and this place did not let me down. The staff is super friendly and brought me a surprise dessert for my birthday that my table didn&#39;t even order! I&#39;m so happy this place is on my block because now I can go there all the time. There is no liquor license but they will happily uncork and pour any wine you bring with you. Go.	1
Garlic chickens are delicious and full of flavor!Lots and LOTS of garlic.If you are a garlic lover like me, I highly recommend it!Hot sticks are just hot enough. they are plump, juicy, crispy yet spicy.perfect combo huh?I also like furaibo chicken however, they are too thin and dry. and I agree with PUFF S that their chicken is the best quality of all the other korean chicken joints 1 less star for the LONG wait.	1
Considering the pollo asado is sitting out for so long, I don&#39;t know how it stays so good. But it is.<br>I only wish that El Palacio de los Jugos had more vegetable options. They serve monstrous rice portions, which never feels like a good idea after the fact. Unfortunately, all they offer otherwise is maduros, tostones, yuca, etc. The typical starchy Cuban stuff. That&#39;s all good every now and then, but the mixed vegetables are a pretty sad healthy alternative. If they did a potaje de garbanzo or even sliced tomatoes with olive oil, that would be great (and easy enough to prep that they could pull it off).	1
Pissed....its open till 6am...we got therebY 2:30 and we were told it was closed!!!!!! The one star was only because I can&#39;t give zero...very disappointed	0
Just an average Italian Family Style place to hit up in Times Square if you want to avoid Carmine&#39;s extra long wait. Food was just average and a bit overhyped. <br><br>Baked Clams: extremely on the salty side. Had better elsewhere<br>Veal Marsala: Bland<br>Rigatoni a la Vodka: it wasn&#39;t al dente like some of the reviews stated<br>Tartufo: The best I had for the night!	0
This place is real tasty and a good deal. For $6.50, you get a grilled chicken and rice platter with salad. The best part is that they use tzatziki sauce because lately I&#39;ve been kinda disgusted by the white/mayo sauce from the halal carts. <br><br>FYI: sometimes the line gets long and it gets somewhat hectic. <br><br>PSA: Free Transfer Available For You!!! <br>Ok...I&#39;m not sure how this works, but this is what I do. I take the 4,5,6 to 59th street and then walk over to Tony&#39;s. Once i get my order, i walk to the Lexington/63rd station and transfer to the F for free when using the same metrocard. So basically i got off the train and scored me a delicious plate at no extra commuting charge. Let me know if it works for you also...	1
This place clearly doesn't read the reviews on here, because nothing has changed and I have experienced some of the same aforementioned issues... They have forgotten my "super" at least 3 separate times, and the chips have been stale the last few times I've been to the Fulton location. Time to figure it out; either drop your prices to make up for the shortcomings of the kitchen, or make sure they're making the damn food correctly! The 2 stars is because I really have experienced better, and expect better!	0
***Drew**** completely saved our experience here yesterday evening. A friend recommended this place for the food, so my girlfriend and I thought we would check it out. <br><br>Our server took our drink and appetizer order and then completely disappeared for 15 minutes, and for the rest of our experience honestly. Drew noticed that we weren&#39;t being taken care of, and completely picked up the slack even though he was already serving multiple tables. By the time our actual server even glanced towards our table, he noticed that our menus had been collected and briefly said &#34;oh, did someone do your order.&#34; Drew refilled our waters, brought us our appetizer, took our meal order, checked on us once we had our food, and gave us our check. Our actual server did none of those things and only stopped by at the end to run our card. <br><br>Long story short, we were both so impressed by Drew. Never once did we get the sense that he was annoyed by the fact that he was taking on someone else&#39;s workload. He was so professional, so incredibly personable, and we loved the food suggestion he gave us!<br><br>THANK YOU DREW!	1
Management here SUCKS! They would take a to-go order by phone claiming they're too busy. Taking a look around they're not busy at all.	0
I probably had the worst dining experience of my life coming here on Valentine&#39;s day. <br><br>BOTTOM LINE: Service is outrageously slow and nothing to write home about. Food - decent if you&#39;re starving.<br><br>The staff was friendly and courteous and helped us to our table immediately since we had a reservation at 8 pm. We were seated around the same time as two other couples near us and We were located in the patio area towards the end of the restaurant. We received the Valentine&#39;s Day specials menu as well as the regular menu, and that&#39;s where I noticed that the price of the lobster ravioli was more expensive on the &#34;specials&#34; menu. Hmm? Interesting, I thought. The same exact item, but more expensive...<br><br>My date and I ordered calamari as an appetizer along with water for the both of us. We received yummy warm bread and this tapenade spread, which my date and I were not a huge fan of. We spent quite a while waiting for our appetizer, even after we ordered our main dish. It had to be at least 45 minutes after we had been seated when our waiter came back out and informed us that they were out of calamari. Ok. Great... In the mean time, the waiter brought us a ceviche-type appetizer, which I wasn&#39;t a fan of. I don&#39;t like fish, but my date liked it. The other couples were finally starting to receive their dinner while my date and I were still waiting. Our waiter finally came around to our table and tried to tell me what I ordered, cannelloni, would not be ready? I say &#34;tried&#34; to tell me because it was so loud and through the waiters accent I had lots of trouble understanding what he said. I was okay with waiting a bit longer, considering we had been there for over an hour already. The other couples got up and left, while we had. <br><br>No more bread and water... My date had enough and got up and spoke to the manager to ask about the status of our meals. He assured us he would look and offered us both wine and my date took a glass. About 15 minutes later, we FINALLY received our dinner! The cannelloni was delicious, and my date enjoyed his carbonara, but I&#39;m not sure if it was actually as good as I thought or because I was starving. The staff gave us a complementary tiramisu to share at the end of our meal. Maybe it was a poor choice to come here for Valentine&#39;s day, but I don&#39;t see myself ever coming back.	0
decent food but got grossed out when i saw that one of the girls making the ceviche wasn&#39;t using gloves.	0
I came in at 12:40 for lunch and it wasn&#39;t that busy. I ordered the rokburger medium done. It took 30 mins to get my food. Service was ok. I had to ask for a refill on drinks. The burger was ok. Extremely greasy. Whenever I took a bite the grease was dripping down my fingers and onto plate. They had to use 70/30 meat. I wont be back.	0
Nice decor!Yeah that's it. Got the tonkotsu deluxe with a side of pork belly...The soup didn't even look milky, it just looked like shoyu broth. Didn't taste milky, either, just salty. I kept hearing his place was good, either the ppl have low standards of ramen or I came on an off day. Still vote for tan popo for a Japantown ramen joint	0
The fried chicken here is no joke. Best food to grab after a night out on the town. You seriously won't regret it unless you get the spicy wings on accident because those are ridiculously hot. Other than the stupid valet for this place and the less than enthusiastic staff this place is on point.	1
Very good food. Got a few small plates amongst four people and enjoyed it all. Goat cheese bruschetta was amazing as was the rigatoni with boar. Cocktails were creative and delicious. Definitely recommend this place.	1
Pretty yummy soup. I like that you can customize and add extras.<br>I came with one other person and we ordered the spam and kimchi jjigae and added ramen noodles. We barely finished half the soup together. Their side dishes are pretty yummy, and the service is pretty good. I would definitely come back with 1 or 2 more people.	1
The food is always fine, not great but fine. However the service is horrible. We live very close but we won't be going back again. We have ordered apps that come 30 mins after ordering and they are cold. We have had apps come after the main course. It is an unprofessional front of house for sure.	0
Everything was bad from the start. The host greeted us with a bad attitude. We waited 15 mins for the server to show his face at the table. Meanwhile, we ordered some drinks and appetizers. The appetizers were ready in literally 30 SECONDS, clearly pre made. Keep in mind we had not yet received water nor our drinks. The first appetizer was the MeliMelo tartare which was not fresh. We complained and they responded &#34;we have the freshest fish in miami and in the country!!&#34; I&#39;ve had fresh tartar before and trust me...this was not fresh at all. Then, to top it off the 2nd appetizer was the burrata which had a piece of what they claimed to be shellfish, but it really looked like a dead cockroach leg. This happened even though we had already mentioned 3 people in our party were allergic to shellfish. <br><br>Overall, the service is mediocre, the food tasteless and not fresh, and water down drinks.<br><br>Do not recommend this place to anyone!	0
The cool thing about this restaurant is the intimacy achieved in a giant LV casino.  You feel like you are in a small restaurant.  We sat right next to the buffet, which was cool because that is where the jazz trio plays. They were really good, but not too loud.  They really regulate how many people are at the brunch at a time by limiting reservations.  When at the buffet, there were only one or two other people there with me.  By Vegas standards this buffet is tiny. It really feels like a hometown country club buffet...with the cool jazz trio.  Included in the buffet are items ordered off the menu.  My husband ordered the Wagyu hot dog and Eggs Benedict that had pulled pork.  Highlights from the buffet were the cold shrimp, they were delicious quality.  We didn't like the crab legs.  The shrimp and grits was terrific, and I loved the corn chowder, who knew?  They had several carved meats: two types of beef, ham and sausage.  They had raw oysters.  For dessert I liked the strawberry shortcake.  Overall it was such a relaxing way to spend a Sunday morning in crazy Vegas. I'd definitely go back.	1
Ate there Saturday noon and it was very disappointing. Service was very slow with wait staff standing around chatting with each other. My wife ordered Caesar Salad and they brought it with no dressing. We also had to ask for a fork three times. Her corn chowder was barely warm. I ordered Pad Thai and it was a congealed mess with little flavor. The Pad Thai at Noodles and Co. is far better. The people on both sides of us were complaining about service, it took 1 hour for them to get their soup and salad order. I noticed neither of them finished their soup. Real glad we didn't try them for dinner as lunch was expensive enough. So many better options in Madison.	0
Are the 5 star reviews here done only by Vietnamese Yelpers trying to be sympathetic towards people from their own country or something?? I&#39;m skeptical that NOBODY has complained about their weird ordering system. Let&#39;s stop hiding and be real people. Even though I&#39;m Korean I critique Korean restaurants in New York very carefully/seriously and if I have to be a total ass, I will. Again, if you&#39;re a true Yelper, plese BE REAL OK???? Now onto the review:<br><br>I wanted to like this place but after a horrible experience, I doubt I&#39;ll ever eat here again. So today, I was able to get off work early and since it was still bright outside and the weather was so gorgeous, decided to head over to Greenwich Village to grab a quick bite from one of the eateries in the area before heading back home. Passed by a number of restaurants and this place seemed really relaxed and casual from outside but went in to try this place out.<br><br>The problem happened as soon I got in line. The two Asian (they looked Vietnamese) girls that were in line n front of me were given a menu to look at and choose their food items while the Cashier lady (Vietnamese and seemed like she was the owner or the mistress perhaps?) waited patiently with a smile. Then, as soon as it was my turn, one of the male servers there takes away the menu from the girls and I was not even given a menu to look at. I was so lost that I had to &#34;re-ask&#34; them for the menu and the Cashier lady &#34;rolled&#34; her eyes. I said I needed some time and let the guy behind me go first. Turns out he wasn&#39;t ready either. After 5 seconds of browsing the menu, decided to get the Spicy Brisket Banh Mi. They asked for my name and didn&#39;t tell me anything afterwards. <br><br>Since the place seemed really casual and you literally order your food in line just like any other casual or fast food establishments, I unloaded my bag and about 5 minutes later, the Cashier lady brought me a plastic bag with the Banh Mi. As I was unwrapping the sandwich I noticed I didn&#39;t get any napkins so I went back to the register to get some napkins and the cashier lady gives me the most fucked up bitchy attitude saying &#34;You know this is a sit-down table service place right?&#34; and gives me a really dirty look. I was confused. I mean you order your food in line but then again, you offer table service?? What the fuck is that? At that moment, I was so mad and ready to explode so I packed up my food and headed towards Washington Square Park where I opened and finished my Banh Mi.<br><br>On the bright side, the Banh Mi was surprisingly good and it was pretty decent size. The brisket was juicy and had the right amount of spiciness with the jalapenos and crunchy carrots. Oh yeah, the bread was awesome too. So the one star I&#39;m giving is on the food only. You just lost 3 stars and a serious Food Connoisseur customer. Sorry won&#39;t be back.<br><br>***NOTE****<br><br>-CASH ONLY<br><br>-THIS IS NOT A CHIPOTLE type of establishment despite how it looks where you order your food in line and you bring your food to a table and help yourself but a very confusing system that they have of where you order in line, give them your name, then you wander around hopelessly and then they bring the finished product to you. Obviously retarded system.	0
We sat outside for about 20 minutes waiting for service and nothing. Had a couple waiters even peek outside. Waste of time.	0
Gave it one star just so I could rate it. Cheap- yea, but it&#39;s just a small baguette w a slice of cheese or 3 small, small shrimps. Don&#39;t waste your time, money, or calories.	0
This was my first visit. I love the interior decoration of this place. Clean. Had a really yummy sundae. A bit pricey though.	0
I&#39;ve not yet checked this place at night but judging from the bar and what&#39;s on tap that might be the time to come. Instead, since this place is stumbling distance away, I went here for brunch, but I&#39;ll be stumbling further on down fifth in the future. <br><br>First of all, we stopped by about 3 minutes before they open on Sunday and we&#39;re turned away. When we came back a little later we were escorted to the back room although the more appealing front area was entirely empty. The back room decor definitely would look better in low light. With the lights on the horrible chipped-up paint job, worse wall art and general clutter were all left exposed and gave the place a dumpy atmosphere. Our waiter, although competent, had a unique serving style that was maybe aiming for unobtrusive but came off as strange and inattentive. <br><br>Our coffee was european strong in a good sized cup, but our food was not impressive. The latka entree was small, the polenta (raved about here) made me wonder what previous yelpers were talking about, and the flatbread was a big puff of sweet overload. I&#39;ve travelled extensively through eastern Europe, lived in EE enclaves in the states, and love the cuisine, but I&#39;m sure any native eating here would have a few words for the chef. And maybe this is a more general gripe, but calling breakfast brunch doesn&#39;t warrant a $6 markup per plate.	0
Yesterday, March 11, 20154 of us enjoyed some tapas selections, 2 salads, chopped and fig and blue delicious.Shrimp was deliciousChicken tacos were goodCalamari was goodBeef in cherry (Beef we thought was overcooked) sauce was deliciousMeatballs very good	1
Great premise, beautiful concept but lacking in so many ways. The servers are woefully unprepared. Some of the food was excellent but several dishes spent too much time under the heat lamps turning med rare into med well. Needs work. Hope it lasts long enough to work out the kinks.	0
I've been a take-out customer for years until their sandwiches started becoming smaller and blander, and their dine-in service started to suck harder. That grandpa behind the counter sure gives a mean attitude when you ask him to add some cheese on your 'wich, sheesh... and forget about asking him for a side of pickles! So what if they are 24/7? So is Jerry's.Now for some shameless propaganda:CANTer's CAN'T make good sandwiches anymore.Canter's is overpriced and impersonal.Jerry's (insert greater than sign prohibited by Yelp) Canter's	0
Is it so? Can't be.	1
Blueberry pancakes. Got that? The. Blueberry. Pancakes. Best pancakes ever. Even better than Dottie&#39;s in San Francisco, if you&#39;ve been there and can believe it.<br><br>Next, the rice balls (on the all day lunch menu). Heaven. Absolutely. Cut one in half, yummy and fried, cheese oozing out from inside. EAT IT. You&#39;ll thank me.<br><br>The steak and poached eggs are also quite good, though never salted enough. But, you can add more.<br><br>Love going to this place for breakfast!<br><br>Note: for those who love booze with their breakfast, they have a full bar.	1
Great food.<br>The tapas is great!<br>Reasonable pricing.<br>One block from the ferry.<br>Entrees are really good too.<br>The lamb chops are amazing.<br>Sangria is great (but the bartender was a little cocky and arrogant - but maybe he had a bad day - the time before that he was cool)	1
I drive by The Wood all the time and have always been meaning to try it so I was happy when a friend wanted to have brunch there this past weekend. <br><br>They was a decent crowd when we got there, but it wasn&#39;t super packed. One of the waitresses practically pushed me out of the way and gave me a dirty look when I walked in, but I&#39;ll overlook that. Maybe she was just really busy. We sat down and looked at the menus. The waiter came by and asked for our drink orders and my friend made a joke while she was ordering, but this guy was not interested in being friendly or laughing. He had a very cold vibe. <br><br>Our drinks came quickly and we ordered our food and then waited... and waited... and waited... we watched everyone else&#39;s food come out as we were practically drooling. <br><br>When the food finally arrived, it was amazing. One of the best brunches I&#39;ve had in quite some time. The waiter never asked how we were doing during our meal, but I didn&#39;t expect that after seeing his attitude. We left a nice tip, but that&#39;s just how we roll. In reality, we should have barely tipped him... maybe that would help him understand that he&#39;s rude!<br><br>I&#39;m torn! I loved the food, but don&#39;t want to deal with slow service and bad attitudes. I&#39;ll probably give it one more shot because I really want to try their red velvet cupcake!<br><br>One other note: my friend and I both looked at our bank accounts online the next day and noticed that we were each charged twice.	0
Well what I can say. The tacos were off the hook! Very tasty and fresh. Everything taste home style. The waiters are attentive and nice. <br><br>I had the chips and salsa. Ammmmmmaxing salsa. One of the best I had in a long time. They also have amazing Guacamole! The chips that come with it are also fire. I also tried the chicken tacos. Perfection! The chicken is jidori with in house marinade, cilantro and onions. I had to try the Carne Asda. Which was grilled steak cilantro and onions with a huge piece of avocado. On top of those tacos I got a side of rice that tasted just like my moms!! Each taco order comes with two tacos. They are a little bit bigger than street tacos. <br><br>This place is great. The price of food could be better. It&#39;s pricey for lunch. Too bad they don&#39;t have a lunch deal. Two thumbs up!!	1
Great food and great atmosphere. Like the simplistic of the entrees and appetizers. Must try 30 hours Sous Vide Berkshire Pork Belly!!! Unexpected flavor combos that taste amazing! If your big fan of kimchi try &#34;Kimchi Pasta with Smoked Mackerel&#34; Nice selection of beers as well. Well done!!!	1
This place has one of the freshest foods and friendly fast service. Very well organized and punctual with your order. They've had some difficulties in the past with making sure everything's on point such as food orders delivery and most importantly Catherine so many ppl at once but it has gotten even better than few weeks ago.. Good job guys keep it up.	1
This place is absolutely amazing. Besides one of the best views in LA the drinks are great. I&#39;ve been to Perch on Friday and Saturday nights and their Happy Hour. Every time was a great crowd. No complaints.	1
Five words- Mac Daddy and Cheese Balls. Yummy yummy yummy. Who wouldn't like fried mac and cheese? Well that is just a small sample of the delicious things that Fred 62 has to offer. Delicious breakfast dishes, I personally love the Bearded Mr. Frenchy which is crunchy french toast. Great noodle bowls, sandwiches, salads and specialties. Their desserts are great, I have a thing for the apple punk tarts. This is one of my all time favorite late night dining restaurants in LA. The prices, while odd are actually pretty reasonable, the service is pretty good, and though there is often a wait for a table, they usually try their best to get you in ASAP. If you want some comfort food that thinks out of the box, come to Fred 62, you will be happily satisfied.	1
This was a great place to have dinner before a show at BAM. I loved the intimate space, the open windows and the open kitchen. It is a small space however, so prepare to get cozy with your neighbors!<br><br>We shared the octopus, avocado, sugar snap peas and chicken. My favorite was probably the snap peas, which was wonderfully fresh and light, while still flavorful and rich. I also really enjoyed the avocado - I hadn&#39;t thought I&#39;d have a new way to experience an avocado, but the peanuts and heat were a nice surprise. I also enjoyed my glass of gewurztraminer, which was very reasonably priced and delicious.	1
We sat down and waited for 10 minutes for someone to take our order. Staff members walked by multiple times, but none would take our completed order forms. We left and got food elsewhere.	0
I had high expectations for this place. The hostess wasn't very inviting and our waitress took forever. The crab cakes were really good and the greens were by far the best I've ever had. Other than that the food wasn't memorable. Max's Restaurant of the Philippines has better fried chicken and Hard Knox Cafe is all around just a better spot.	0
Foods are ok. <br>Service.. I asked for a refill on water a few times by talking to waitresses and pressing the call bell a few times but never got one. My table number displayed on a screen when I pressed the call bell but later they turned it off. They turn it off if they don&#39;t want to see a table number.On my way out, I saw a number displayed on the screen and someone get served for a refill of water..	0
Once again, this place doesn't disappoint. I came here again with a few friends Friday night. Unfortunately we decided to come here last minute so we weren't able to make a reservation. Once we got here we were told wait for 4 would take anywhere from 30 min to an hour. We were able to secure two seats at the bar for the ladies and had a few drinks. Throughout the hour, I went up to the host to check on the wait. Each time the host with a smile said that she would let us know when we were ready. Then suddenly without notice, the hostess comes up to me and says that our table isn't ready, but that there is a sofa section that is "first come, first serve" that just opened up and that we could drink and dine there instead. THAT IS AWESOME SERVICE. I was really impressed with her going out of her way to help us out. I couldn't help but to hand her a $20 to really say I appreciated her help. As far as food goes, I had the "bunny ravioli". Sounds disturbing, try not to imagine cute lil' furry friends. But I have to admit, it was delicious! Meat was really soft & moist, texture & flavor sort of reminded me of shredded beef. Sauce brought the whole dish together. They had a live jazz band that night, and brought in a dj to close the night off. A great place to have awesome conversations with friends. My guests were impressed that I suggested this place. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!	1
Been a happy customer at Gogi King for awhile... But now, no longer heading back. A first and foremost, they got rid of BANCHAN (Korean Side Dishes). Rather, they bring out random tacos, ramen and ddukboki to fill you up before the meat. Secondly, what happened to the meat? They are all frozen, not fresh, and got rid of galbi and ribeye from the normal menu. Just like that, from a happy customer to a very disappointed one.I have brought countless friends, families, and colleagues to this place... But now, gotta warn them to find other restaurants.  Might as well just raise the price and keep everything the same... Very disappointed... Why Gogi King Why!?	0
This is a nice small non-chain coffee shop. The owners and my waitress were very attentive.<br><br>I had the lobster melt with fruit cup. The sandwich was very good and the fruit was fresh. Service was not slow. My meal was cooked to order.<br><br>I recommend and will be back. The patio would be a nice place to sit in the Spring or Autumn when LV weather is nice.	1
This is my fav breakfast spot in LA for 5 reasons:1. best pancakes 2. best coffee in a porcelain mug3. Mediterranean omelet is divine4. the staff is genuinely awesomeand 5. the trannies walking past on Sunday morning make for great people watching.	1
I'm happy to see people consistently rating this 2-3 stars because the food is standard pub food--nothing exceptional. When I had first moved to Madison for some reason we ate here all the time (Current Tally of Birthday mugs: 5). I say the only reason to eat here is for a friends birthday (if they want a mug). Though it isn't a bad place to eat before or after a Badger game though it is pretty busy at those times--I'd more identify this as a classic place to get a beer when you are in your Badger gear, they always have the good/standard Wisconsin Craft Beers.	0
I've been eating here for years. One of the best diners I've ever eaten in. The ham and cheese omelet is great. Ask for a side of salsa with the omelet, it's even better. The buckwheat pancakes are good and so is the sourdough bread. Not too sure about the dinner menu but breakfast is exceptional. Get there before 9:00am or you'll be waiting in line. Easily one of LA's best.	1
Waited 20 minutes for 20 pieces of chicken. Ridiculous! 2 groups of people that came in after us got their orders first. Gave them an extra star for their Soy Garlic Chicken (which was good!), the only thing that kept this review from being a 1 star. Customer service could use a little improvement.	0
BASIC BASIC BASIC. I guess maybe because I'm Hispanic I expected their tex-mex spin on food to be a bit more flavorful, but that wasn't the case. I sat at the bar , so grabbed a cocktail. I believe I got the roadrunner: mezcal it was savory and balanced ; good job hipster like bartender. Service was prompt . Server was sweet. BUT I probs won't be coming back not suggesting it to my friends... It just lacked the BANG effect on such a cool street.	0
*Update* 9/18/07Well, to be honest, they have been sliding downward in both food quality and service....No lie, the last 8 times I have been there there has been a problem with food...From everything to missing part of the order to waiting 45 minutes for a cold piece of pie when I was almost the only person in the place....The bartender even joked that he felt bad for me because it kept happening....But last night was the last straw....I ordered the Purple Potato Soup, and after about 20 minutes it came out cold and about half full, so I asked if they could heat it up...After ten minutes more it came back out with the bowl almost full, but all watered down, like they had put a cup of boiling water in it....It had been thick! WTF?! I used to come here every week and bring friends, now I wouldn't be caught dead eating that crap!3/01/2007OK...I had been coming here almost every week since they first opened and I have to say that the food and service are pretty uneven...One time I went in and order the roasted beet salad, and it was perfect...Fresh little roasted beets, that were so sweet they tasted like candy, so good in fact that I came back the next night to have it again...And it was sliced canned beets!!!!!!Cold!!! Oh the horror! I was pretty disappointed, but all-in-all it was still a nice salad, so I wasn't going to freak out over it, but sometimes it is kinda like that...A bit hit or miss, but still pretty good....As far as the service, they are starting to recognize me (I sit at the bar), so it is getting better, but other times I find myself trying frantically to get someones attention, only to have them come over to tell me they are not the bartender...and it's not even busy!...But I like the place and I still stop by on the way home occasionally, just not as often anymore...I just don't know what I will get.	0
Wow is all I can say. I haven't been here in a while but their food is amazing. We need a food adventure on Saturday and it was pretty late, on our way to get burgers some one said we should go to the Pantry, and we did. The best choice in my opinion. Their bacon-cheese omelet is still cheese-bacon perfection, with a side of sourdough and potatoes to tame the salty goodness. Lets not forget the side of pancakes. The pancakes are EVIL I TELL YOU! anything that good has to be super bad. I can't wait to go back.	1
The customer service here is pretty good but it may seem a bit on the slow side. The burgers are small but average with a lot of lettuce (I like vegetable so I don&#39;t mind it). The fries look so yummy! I didn&#39;t get it since it was a late dinner and we were ordering desserts! I wasn&#39;t too fond of the apple pie. The crust was too hard and the apple is too soft. The banana creme pie was pretty good, but I can taste the egg in the crust. Overall I think it&#39;s a pretty decent place.	1
I don&#39;t just love lobster rolls, I tend to plan my vacations around them. <br><br>The Lobster Pound&#39;s Maine-style roll was overflowing with delicious lobster meat but lacked taste. I think it could have used a dash of celery salt (like at Luke&#39;s Lobster) to bring out the different flavors.<br><br>The green onion/scallions added a nice texture and crunch to the roll. I enjoyed my trip in Red Hook but found this lobster roll to be underwhelming.	0
A LA institution and the food is typical NY deli style...nothing special really. A bit overpriced and the bakery is ok; most items are a bit stale tasting. Haven&#39;t been back since 2010 when I saw a cockroach crawling up the wall while waiting to be served...eat at your own risk. The &#34;A&#34; doesn&#39;t mean much I guess...	0
I lived in Seattle for 20 years and I've had my share of good bad and mediocre dim sum. Macky's is truly outstanding. The food is fast fresh and incredibly tasty. Restaurant is very clean staff are courteous and the atmosphere is family-friendly. The steamed pork buns and honeyed cashew prawns are out of this world! Great value and hidden gem of Issaquah.	1
Something different!<br><br>Let me start off by saying that Barton G is very loud and extremely crowded. The tables are kind of squeezed in together to make the most of the limited space. The bar area is small and not separated from the main dining area. It&#39;s just all one big (or small) room.<br><br>When we got to Barton G, we weren&#39;t seated right away while they got the table ready. The host came by to keep us updated, so we just hung out at the bar &amp; had some drinks.<br><br>So~ this is what we ordered throughout the night:<br><br>DRINKS~ We ordered some regular cocktails, like the Moscow Mule, Bloody Mary, etc. We also ordered a couple each of the Diamonds Are Forever, Sabrinatini, Buddhalicious, Zen-Tini. LOVE!! I especially liked the vodka sticks that melt into your drink depending on how much you want in there. I was kinda disappointed that the Diamonds Are Forever wasn&#39;t in its presentation tray, but the drink I got was pretty.<br><br>FOOD~ Lobster Pop-Tarts, Voodoo Shrimp Rolls, Laughing Bird Popcorn Shrimp, Lobster Trap Mac &amp; Cheese (add French Truffle for $25), Strike Out Sliders, Blooming Black Cod, Say Ahhh Surf &amp; Turf, Waygu 6oz.<br><br>I loved the lobster pop-tarts and lobster mac &amp; cheese in particular. Everything was tasty though!<br>Our server (Kevin?) was great. He was efficient &amp; pleasant. <br><br>I happened to be sitting at the corner of our table, so I probably got bumped into about a couple dozen times throughout the night. However, it&#39;s definitely not the servers&#39; or busboys&#39; fault they have to work in such cramped quarters.<br><br>&#34;The Damage?&#34; Just shy of $1k! That includes drinks, food, and tip.<br><br>Was it worth it? Yes.<br>Would I go back? Definitely.	1
Pizza was undercooked and overpriced.	0
Apparently they don't let you add on any orders, after the initial. "It'll take 30m for the pancakes" then "Sorry, we cannot add to your order." After we had to change tables so they can accommodate a larger party. Didn't bring out the vinegar dip for a while.Dumplings were OK. Chives and lamb didn't stand out, like Northern Dumplings in Flushing. It took a while for the XLB (we basically finished everything else for over 15m), and we saw them bring in a fresh order from outside somewhere. (It took that long for the XLB, but they wouldn't take a pancake order.)Their orange sauce was kind of Sriracha like, and definitely not like La Vic's.Anyways, leaving hungry and unsatisfied. Too bad too, we were going to buy a large order of the frozen stuff to bring to a party.	0
I should start my review with biggest complaint because the food here is very good, but, if I&#39;m paying $12 for crispy pork belly I think it wouldn&#39;t be too much to ask that it comes with a side of white rice to make it a meal.<br>That being said, the crispy pork belly was hands down one of the best things I&#39;ve tried here so far, the portion is quite small just so you know.<br><br>Everything I&#39;ve tried here so far has been really good to great, so don&#39;t let the location turn you off to trying it. Also don&#39;t confuse it with the Thai place literally next door which serves decent Thai as well but I think this place takes the Cake.	1
Great tasting and quite a variety.	1
Nothing was bad but nothing save maybe the mac and cheese which was an excellent side would make me come back. All of the mains had the same basic flavors zero contrast. I suppose if you love kimchi flavored everything this is the place for you.	0
Went there because we needed to shop around the area and wanted a quick lunch. Three powerful reasons why I&#39;m not going back:<br><br>#1 - The food is mediocre at best. Sort of Taco Bell for twice the price<br>#2 - The upselling is ferocious. Everything I ordered, an order of nacho, a quesadilla and some tacos was upsold. The girl behind the cash register kept pushing me for additional sides (e.g., meat on my nachos) without telling me that they were extra. Not that I care, but the experience is a huge turnoff and speaks volume about their ethics.<br>#3 - The place is outrageously noisy. So noisy --on a Sunday at 1pm!-- that I could barely talk to my spouse across the table.<br><br>A most unpleasant experience!	0
So I couldn&#39;t believe that I was eating healthy Cuban food! I didn&#39;t even know that existed! Full of flavor, low salt, low fat, simply delicious. Even the dessert (I had ricotta) was great, and it had no sugar! Now, the icing on the cake was the service: such a warm, kind, and pleasant lady! This combination of good food and excellent customer service is a rare find, so even though my first thought was to just stop by and take a look, I ended up staying, enjoying the tasty food and loving the wonderful company. Definitely recommend!	1
Must go back to try everything on their menu.<br><br>Had the soft shell crab po boy, Japanese beef short rib taco, raw ahi tuna taco, and the carnitas pork taco. They were all very delicious. The crab could have been bigger, but nonetheless, had great flavor and was very satisfying. While some of their components are fried and certainly not the healthiest, nothing was overly greasy or too heavy. All ingredients were very fresh and vibrant. Also, while everything was flavorful, nothing was too salty, which is a common hindrance of many other places. Each taco (and I assume the other items) seems to be very well thought out, cohesive and well balanced.<br><br>What I loved even more than their food was their service. My food was ready to be picked up at the counter and the guy saw that I was struggling and he apologized that he should have just brought the food to my table in the first place. The guys there were genuinely very happy and excited and helpful.<br><br>Extremely tasty elevated diner/street food and one of the best services I&#39;ve ever experienced (others, take note)! Can&#39;t wait to come back!	1
Every time we come here we have awful service. And the manager turned off the sound to a football game in OT. When we asked to turn it back on he said, &#34;OK, but we aren&#39;t a sports bar.&#34; Definitely not coming back. And we continued to come back despite the awful service. But rudeness won&#39;t be tolerated...	0
Another great lunch stop in the Arts District! My friend and I stopped in for a hearty lunch: I got the Carbonnade de Flamande; he got the Grilled Cheese Melt (quite possibly the most boring thing on the menu LOL). Predictably, he said his was okay. But we agreed that mine was truly something special: two medallions of beef on a bed of sauteed spinach over mashed potatoes. I could not do it justice, but the flavor was stellar. All libations are Belgian, and a host of options are available. The Mort Subite Kriek is especially worthy. A special thumbs-up to Travis, our server, for all the amazing suggestions. They all paid off.	1
Some in our party were hungry (me), and others in our party just wanted something to nibble on with their drinks. Marietta did a good job of satisfying us all. I had the soft-shell crab special, which was deliciously salty. My friends loved the quail, and we all enjoyed the smoky pork shoulder rillette thing (it was called something else on the menu). Only the fried green tomatoes were a little too deep-fried for our liking. The service was fine, none of the delays or issues reported elsewhere. Can&#39;t wait to come back and have a cocktail or two. A great addition to the neighborhood.	1
Dirty. Like dirt on the forks and knives dirty. <br>Bad service. They never came back to check on us and the guy next to us got his burger a full 5 minutes after his fries. <br>Not delicious. Certainly not umami. <br>Will never be back.	0
Service: I&#39;d give it 5 stars. Despite its trendiness, the staff was surprisingly engaging and friendly. Food: all over the place. The bacon covered lamb chops were an enormous disappointment. They were 2 of the smallest lamb chops I&#39;ve ever seen...and I could have lived with that if they weren&#39;t horribly overcooked and gamey. It was like lamb jerky. This was followed by my porterhouse pork chop which was perfect and HUGE, served over a tasty bed of black eyed peas and cabbage. My friends weren&#39;t so lucky. 2 of them got a sadly uneventful spaghetti dish. The other got the deep fried skate which, though yummy, was more like fast food over thousand island dressing. They bounced back with some delicious desserts. Now for the drinks. They were truly a travesty. They were $15. If they had been interesting, or strong, or large I wouldn&#39;t complain about the price. Unfortunately, I had the Pisco Sour which is a drink I&#39;m particularly picky about and this was the worst Pisco Sour I&#39;ve ever had. A drink that is notoriously strong and bitter was so weak and sweet that I finished it in about 2 minutes...and it was small. My friends had various other specialty cocktails. They complained about them being weak and packed with ice. This is unforgivable...the worst offense. Now for the bathroom. There is only 1 bathroom and the place holds about 125 people. Just not cool AT ALL. And to top this off, there was a girl in this tiny bathroom (which is elevated 3 steps over the bar area) who did not lock the door. So I open the door and she&#39;s standing up with her bare ass toward the door doing god knows what, screams (causing the bar area which is packed to look up) and pushes the door closed. She emerges a few minutes later and I just looked the other way because eye contact was more than I could handle at that point. And the entire bar has seen her butt. As for the crowd at the bar - think &#34;desperate overdressed girls&#34; and &#34;creepy lecherous dudes&#34;...all thinking they are wildly hip for being south of Houston St....painful.	0
Great spot and full bar! I've had tons of things on the menu and all were great. I would definitely come back!!	1
Had this on the list for a few weeks. Was really in the mood for good Pommes Frites. We stopped by on a Sunday night. They have valet, but lots of close pay-by-phone parking available. We were given a nice outside table outside. Staff was efficient and attentive. As you may know, menu has one entree, steak! Was done to perfection and unlimited fries and sauce were delicious. Manager stopped by to check on us during the meal. The desert choices are great. I had the Profiteroles served with nutella sauce, wife had the Creme Brulee. Unfortunately, Ii had not set correctly. they comped it and offered to make her something else right away.	1
Are you kidding me right now??!!!  CUT absolutely blew us away!!!  Our experience was BEYOND excellent!!!  From start to finish, they made us feel so special... I thought maybe they sat the wrong people or something.  Perhaps they thought we were VIP members of a royal family????  Nope!  Let's start from the beginning...- made my reservation on OpenTable and i typed in a small note that this was our 15 yr anniversary and just hoped for a nice table which to us meant maybe not too close to the kitchen where it might be loud....  I didn't think much of it.- arrived to find they had set up a beautiful, quiet and large romantic booth just for the 2 of us. ELEGANT IN EVERY WAY!- looked at the menu and saw that it had been personalized and printed especially for us and under our name which was just so sweet- lovely and attentive staff checked on us regularly and made sure glasses were filled and our needs were met at all times- quality steaks were BEYOND!!!! JUST BEYOND AMAZING!!!- we were so full and satisfied at the end of the meal we decided to pass on the dessert... The Cut Staff would not accept that on our special night and brought out their favorite dessert COMPLIMENTS OF THE HOUSE, with the words &quot;Happy 15th Anniversary&quot; written in chocolate... WE LOVED IT!  Don't know what else to say other than....    Thank you, CUT!!!  You made our anniversary a night too remember!!!!	1
So thrilled this place has moved in! It&#39;s exactly the sort of business I&#39;ve been hoping would come downtown...a specialty shop that will become a destination for folks. <br><br>I met Samantha early on and she&#39;s so friendly and excited about her place...Ebbie and June are also lovely, and really get the DTLA vibe. <br><br>Had a bunch of samples as they were getting things rolling...sausage roll, spinach feta roll, chicken pie, latte...all delicious. They pour Longshot coffee, which is yummy.<br><br>I&#39;ve gone in multiple times since, and it&#39;s always casual, friendly, and chill - folks hanging out at the counter, on laptops, just hanging out. It&#39;s a great food to take away, too.<br><br>The rolls are made with a wonderfully flaky pastry around the meat or veggies and cheese. The pies have rich but not overpowering fillings, and the crusts are tender and tasty. They also offer a vegan option, which is very smart.<br><br>It&#39;s located off of Los Angeles Street in the alley that leads into the Santee courtyard...look for the Subway, then turn into the alley.	1
Oooh how I love chowdah!	1
If you are looking for an intimate, friendly restaurant with delicious food, this is your place. We had the ossobuco and swordfish, which were both perfectly cooked. The beef carpaccio was not my favorite but the fresh mozarrella and tomatoes were spot on. There was a little bit of a wait for a table but well worth the wait. The service was excellent and attentive. They say this place is not good for kids but we brought our kids and we were fine. We definitely will be back for more.	1
I have absolutely zero idea how this place is so popular. I must have completely missed something during my visit.Went with a friend and we got the huevos rancheros, the breakfast wrap, a regular coffee and an iced coffee. Came out to ~$30. Not unreasonable.Picked up the drinks at the counter, then had to walk all the way to the other side of the place to get some creamer, which especially sucked because they didn't leave room for any and they only had whole milk. Didn't even mind that I spilled half the coffee on the floor by the time I got back to the table.After 20 minutes our food came to our table, carried by a gentlemen who apologized because apparently they gave us the wrong number. Didn't even give us utensils, napkins or condiments. Slow and bad service, but that wasn't even the main problem.The food was disgusting. I found a rock in my huevos rancheros and I'm pretty sure I'm going to want to faint when I have to go to the bathroom next. The sandwich wrap looked just as bad. But I did realize that most of the other patrons of this establishment had only ordered coffees and drinks; not food. Regardless, the coffee at this place was not that good anyways.	0
For a place that's only been open four days they have their act together pretty well. The space is very nice for the neighborhood. Simple but warm and inviting. The current pics don't do it justice. Service staff was informed and courteous. Now the food: Overall everything had a good amount of flavor. The deviled eggs were very good but not amazing. Spaghetti with meatballs was tasty but was a little too spicy for my 8 year old. However, he gobbled up the meatballs and he's not a big meat eater. The Italian sausage with beans and greens had a great flavor. My daughter ordered the steak and it was delicious and perfectly cooked. The halibut was fantastic, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The veggies give a nice contrast in texture and flavor to the fish. The only real letdown was the linguine and clams. It was way over-seasoned with crushed red pepper and very coarse black pepper. It overpowered the taste of the clams and had way too much salt. Overall we left feeling excited that there is a quality italian restaurant in the neighborhood that is still kid friendly.	1
We had reservations but had to wait 1/2 hour to be seated. For appetizers we had the still warm mozzarella which was very good. We also had the chicken and pork sausage with potato salad which was very good. For dinner I had the akaushi cheeseburger which I did not like at all (I took two bites and handed it over to my husband). Shake Shack has a better burger. The fries that came with it were good. My husband had the tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella and basil pizza which was not that great either. Our server was great and very friendly. After all the hype we heard about ABC Kitchen, we were disappointed.	0
Kevin was great!!! The presentation was amazing ! I tired the wagyu steak and I loved it.	1
Never brought my tea and desert until I asked. Then they charged us for extras they brought to our table we never ordered! Seriously? The only reason they even get a star because food was ok.	0
I have been going to The Apple Pan since as far back as I can remember. I think the same holds true for my parents generation and grandparents generation (not that either in my family are from Los Angeles).<br><br>Simply put, this is a special place. I&#39;m almost offended when I see people comparing it to In-N-Out. And yes, I like In-N-Out.<br><br>The Apple Pan is an LA institution. The place has looked the same my entire life... There is only counter seating, there is grandmother-type wallpaper, and the cash register is 500 years old (well, basically).<br><br>The employees here have been there forever. I recognize the day workers and the night workers. They are ALWAYS the same people.<br><br>The burgers are absolutely delicious and totally unique. They are very filling, much more-so that most other burgers. They have a unique apple-based sauce. The fries are great, and for some reason the Coke just tastes better out of the little paper cone that they serve it to you in. The Tuna Sandwich is very good, and so I hear... the Egg Salad Sandwich is also very good. Not to mention, you must try the Apple Pie.<br><br>This is the type of place where you get regulars like me who have been coming in again and again for their entire lives. You will see that many patrons will know the guys behind the counter on a first name basis and visa versa.<br><br>Nothing but 5-stars from me... I really want to go there for dinner right now...<br><br>And yes, expect a wait... at all hours of the day or night.	1
*sigh*Inattentive wait staff. Unimpressive food. Yet, really lovely music. That was a nice touch, but I can play my own jazz music at home. Smoooooth jazz. And heat up pot stickers from Costco. Really? Is there nowhere good to eat in SOMA. Please tell me there is a hidden gem within a reasonable walking distance of our house. That has dinner service.	0
not all that view is great long is long and dome , food is not that good , customer service could be way better	0
The Bobbie: delicious homemade turkey and stuffing, but the cranberry sauce was the downside for me. i love cranberries but not with my meat. it&#39;s just a bit odd with all the sweetness when it isn&#39;t matched by any saltiness<br><br>Capastrami: love the name, not so much the sandwich...the meat is very sweet, almost in a bad way. maybe it was the russian dressing or the cole slaw but this was a disappointment because i loooooove pastrami<br><br>order the largest size for ~$12 and cut it up and share with everyone. there&#39;s definitely enough to feed 3 people with one sub. by the time we left, the place was packed. glad i tried something off the strip for once!	0
I am a huge fan of boiling crab, I&#39;ve been to different boiling crabs in norcal and socal; honestly, this is the worst that I&#39;ve ever had. I always think boiling crab is better than hot n juicy, no matter the seasoning, freshness of it&#39;s seafood. <br>My gf and I ordered 1lb of frozen crawfish, 2lb of shrimp is different sauce; I knew the frozen crawfish taste bad, I haven&#39;t eaten the frozen one before, so I wanted to give it a shot, but I was totally regretted. DO NOT TRY THE FROZEN CRAWFISH!!!<br>on the other hand, our shrimp order is a bit weird. I could tell the freshness is different in each bag. I had no idea but the other bag is fishy and spoiled (very much!).<br>I knew restaurants could not give their best to every customers. I am not the kind of spreading &#34;DO NOT GO HERE&#34; after having bad experience. I always like boiling crab, so I would give another shot.	0
This review applies specifically to their weekend brunch. ABC Kitchen is probably a better venue for dinner or some kind of evening meal. The restaurant was extremely dark for a mid-afternoon meal! I had to ask our server to figure out how to turn the light on above our table just so I could read the menu. Two women sat down at a table next to mine and they immediately asked to be re-seated at another table (they didn&#39;t have any additional lights that could be turned on). Found myself wishing I had done the same. Aside from these complaints, the food was only alright (some items were far too salty - i.e. cheddar chive biscuits). Bottom line - really just not worth the price/ effort to dine here for brunch.	0
I will start by saying there is much to like about this restaurant from a location and aesthetics standpoint. It really drew us in. The night we ate there, it was really busy and we sat outside with a view of the capitol. We were kind of forgotton about and had to wait a really long time for all of our food. I am gluten free and this is the main reason I am writing this review. I find reviews of how restaurants handle those who eat this way, for whatever reason, so helpful. This restaurant has a GF menu (I have celiac) which was a huge bonus. However my soup which I ordered off the GF menu came out with a huge slice of sourdough laying on the soup spoon. Not a huge deal to get another spoon but made me nervous as to how aware they really were. Then the wait for our entrees took so long I had to leave with my 2 year old daughter because she had run out of patience. I am sure it is great on less busy nights, but we weren't able to enjoy the experience that night.	0
Oh NO! Are you kidding me? Drive around for 20 minutes to find parking, wait in line to sit on a stool, order from a grumpy waiter, order burger fries soda and pie, Get small un-memorable portions and pay $15 and leave. For the same price take two friends to In and out or one friend to The Counter, Those waxing nostalgia for this place are lost in a dream.	0
This was the first place I visited when arriving in Los Angeles last week and it&#39;s first impression did not disappoint! Went on sunday so we were able to catch the brunch special and the incredible bottomless drink menu! they do not skimp on the good stuff in the drinks and never let your glass sit empty for very long. The food was delicious and portions huge! oh yeah, and their appetizer?... froot loops and lucky charms!!	1
Super tasty food (I had a smoked salmon sandwich), but be aware that if you order your sandwich on ciabiatta bread, you&#39;ll end up with something half the size of other sandwiches. Which was actually a good size for me and would have been fine if they charged half the price but...<br><br>But they serve Lavazza coffee! Yum. Croissants were decent but not the best I&#39;ve ever had in Miami.	1
Perch should be named a &#34;speakeasy&#34; since it&#39;s somewhat hidden as you have to enter a building and go up two elevators to reach this spot. We came here for a rooftop gathering with some friends and enjoyed the spectacular view of downtown LA and the delicious Manhattans. The drinks were definitely well-made and we met the bouncer, Rene, who was very friendly. We will return again sometime and maybe check out the food as well.	1
Stopped by to by bread and chocolate croissantsFirst it was really expensive , $36 for 2 loafs of bread, 2 2 chocolate croissants and 1 coffee.The worst part of it is that it was just not good at all. Bread is better and much cheaper at whole foods and croissants are better everywhere else.Two stars for the nice decor only	0
By the time we came here, we were hangry. We tried two other places and either they were closed or too busy. That means this place had to come through or we would have flip their tables like Chinese gangster style (maybe not that exaggerated)<br><br>We ordered the roti, the first noodle soup dish and lamb. Being hungry, we devoured each dish before the next came out. The Roti was not fried so it was not greasy. I rather liked it more this way. It also came with a bowl of curry for dipping. There was a piece of chicken and potato in the bowl. For less than $5, it was really awesome.<br>The noodle dish was good and had a seafood flavor like Big Wong&#39;s shrimp soup. What I didn&#39;t like about the noodle dish is I think it was spaghetti noodles, and I usually like soft noodle but these were almost mushy. The lamb was not gamey and had all this brown sauce over it. When I see that I think it would be too salty but it was actually perfect in flavor. These are not flavors I am used I&#39;m not even sure what they used to make it with. We finished everything. <br><br>What I didn&#39;t like was their tea. It was supposed to be Jasmine but they were flavorless bags of tea. <br><br>We will come back to try the rest of their menu.	1
I&#39;m so sorry Romeo to do this to you, but I feel like you left room for improvement. The atmosphere is romantic, you are charming and your food is delicious, but your location and quality of food do not match your pricing. I really, really wanted to give you 5 stars, but I didn&#39;t have the heart to tell you in person that filet mignon doesn&#39;t need to be cut into small pieces and added to risotto if it really is the cut you price it to be...<br><br>I will say, I left full and there were moments that reminded me of some of my mother&#39;s best cooking, but I don&#39;t understand how you justify pricing yourself above Prime 112, Casa Tua, or Michael&#39;s Genuine. At $150/per person, after wine, gratuity and tax, you are the most expensive restaurant in Miami.	0
