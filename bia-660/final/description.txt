There are two files, one called training.txt and a second one called testing.txt

The first file (training.txt) includes 1 review per line and 2 tab-separated columns. The first column is the review text and the second column is the label (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

The second file includes 1 review per line. The line includes only the text of the review, but not the label.
This is similar to the setting that we have seen in class, with some in-class assignments.

Your script should predict the label for each of the reviews in testing.txt.
It should then write the labels to a file called predictions.txt
Write one label per line (1 for positive 0 for negative), as follows:

0
1
0
1
1
0

Your script should execute in 10 minutes or less.
