You are given a file called input.txt
Your task this week is to write a python script that will read the file, and find ALL trigrams (3-grams) that:

- include at least 2 nouns
- do not include any stopwords

The 3-grams should be written in a file called trigrams.txt
Write one 3-gram per line with a space between the terms. For example:

new york city
not very good

- Use the dot as a sentence splitter
- Use nltk's list of stopwords
- Don't forget to lower case the document and remove non-letter characters.
- The 3-grams should be written in the order that they appear in the document (based on their first occurrence)
