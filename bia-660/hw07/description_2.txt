Consider the previous extra credit assignment of Week 7, regarding typed checkins. In that assignment you were asked to process ONLY the reviews of the given URL.

Modify your script so that it works for ALL pages of reviews for the given user URL, found in the profile.txt input file.

As an example, if you are given the following user profile URL: http://www.yelp.com/user_details_reviews_self?userid=9I1w-E6w5c5FZhkXXLodZA you should extract the typed checkins for all 9 pages of reviews.

Other than that, the same rules of the previous assignment apply: Your input file is profile.txt and it contains only 1 URL.
The retrieved information must be written to an output file called type_freqs.txt
In that file, you must write the TYPE and its associated CHECK-IN according to the specifications described in the previous assignment.
Each such pair (TYPE, COUNT) must appear on a SEPARATE line, and the two values need to be separated by a COMMA.
The output MUST be sorted lexicographically by the TYPE.

Sample output for the given URL is shown below:

Afghan,4
American (New),1
Bakeries,2
Barbeque,1
...

Updated reviews and multiple checkins must be dealt with in the same way as explained in the previous assignment. The cutoff date is (again) July 1st, 2010.

* ATTENTION: Do NOT use Selenium. Do NOT use libraries which are not built-in into python (e.g., beautifoul soup, scrapy, etc). In both cases, you'll be getting errors. Use urllib2 for the assignment.
* ATTENTION: Make sure that your input works in the GENERAL case. For example, TEST with the given profile for the 3rd page. Beware of the UPDATED review.
