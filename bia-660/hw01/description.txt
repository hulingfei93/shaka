You are given a file named input.txt

The file contains posts by several people.
Each post is a single line in the file that was provided.
Values in each line are separated by the "@" character, just like we saw in the class.
The difference is that each line now contains 4 values, in the following order

The first value in a line is the state where that person posted from
The second value is the name of the person who made the post
The third value is the day of the week
The last value is the text of the post


A sample line from the file is the following

NJ@George@Thursday@We meet for BIA 660 every Thursday


Your assignment is to write a single python script that will read the file and
find which words appear only once in all of the posts that we have available.


The script should write the results to a file, named output.txt
Each unique word must appear in a single line.
