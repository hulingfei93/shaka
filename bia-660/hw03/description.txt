You are given a file called input.txt

The file includes the username of a different freelancer in each line. For example:
thetechie13
appstudiozsl

etc.


These are valid usernames, that belong to freelancers on https://www.freelancer.com
For each freelancer, we want to get information about them in a structured way.
More specifically, for each freelancer, we want the following information: 

Attr1: Percentage of jobs completed
Attr2: Percentage of jobs on budget
Attr3: Percentage of jobs delivered on time
Attr4: Percentage of repeated hire rate


Your job is to write a python script that will read through the file input.txt and extract the desired information for every freelancer in that file.
The script must write the extracted information to a file called stats.txt where the information of each freelancer is on a separate line.

The information that you write in the stats.txt file must be separated by a semi-colon ( ; ) and must have the following format:

username;Attr1;Attr2;Attr3;Attr4


We are only interested in the NUMERICAL value, not the percentage sign. For example, for the freelancer "thetechie13", the corresponding output line will be:

thetechie13;88;96;86;21


The order of the users in stats.txt should be the same as in input.txt
